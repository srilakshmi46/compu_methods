this is a fun and entertaining book about learning to work together and share it is repetitive and easy to follow so very young children can participate in the reading too i have a copy of it with an old narration set to music that makes it even more enjoyable i wish the recording was still available
started a big slow but once into it the authors ability to draw you into the characters and foibles really makes for an entertaining read
received this book as a christmas present i had seen his film bowling for columbine so i knew more or less what to expect moores books and films are anything but neutral or journalism in the ordinary sense they are moores perspective and opinions and if you agree with him then moore rules  but if you dont he can be pretty infuriatingive been involved in several heated debates regarding the issues he raises and know first hand how many of moores assertions are real hot buttons for some americans  i recommend this book to any thinking person  especially americans  would dont mind having their assumptions challengedit can be liberating

i agree with those reviewers that believe that this is not agathats best work far from it her foray is mystery and this books attempts to be a thriller which doesnt work at all i cannot say that the writing is bad but this entire book is just not interesting her other books that have to do with world organizations are much better although also couldnt be compared to her regular setting of a family murder so much of the plot just doesnt make sense and apart from the three main characters everyone else remain hazy which is never the case in any of her other books i have the entire collection and must say that this is her most unsuccessful literary attempt
then i watch american masters pbs featuring author margaret mitchell and was fascinated by her life story  so i logged on to amazon and purchased the kindle edition  the book is everything i remembered and more  especially after seeing the movie lincoln i realize how many references to the civil war were pretty much on target in mitchells book  the characters are so real alive and vividly described i cannot help feeling i am there taking it all in  when i first read the book i was like scarlett so bored with the talk of war  now over  years later i am fascinated to read about the southerners opinion about the war before it started and when the battles begin  gwtw is a great book  read it and you will agree
i am a fan of all of teppers books  i had been waiting for a new book for what seemed ages and was not disappointed by this oneher characters are always well thought out and well rounded out and she has a way of making you feel that you actually know these peoplethis book follows a simialr theme of most of the rest of her books  the earth is depleted people are living in stark conditions and a few brave souls want to preserve whats left of the animals of earth with dogs being a major player  she has good aliens and bad aliens and some really odd lifeforms which she seems to enjoy populating her novels with  this is one of the things i like about teppers books her aliens are really alien
my granddaughter got me interested bin this series i find it to be very interesting and well written she is waiting for me to finish so she can have the book
yes its a difficult read with so many thomases  why oh why are all the major players called thomas my advice is to start writing down the names of the major players their royal titles and nick names so that you can refer to that often and not get too confused eg thomas boleyn lord wiltshire monseigneura fascinating insight into the sexual and political intrigue of the tudor court the story of thomas cromwells life is just so interesting with his rise to prominence through his intelligence contacts and diplomatic skills but he was always an outsider
i dont think i ever read the original version but i really liked this one  im a fan of kleypas books anyway  the political background was pertinent to the realism to show the complexity of daily lives under the constant changing of governments and political influences and how local societies do their own thing  and get away with it  when governments are unstable
wheres the beefstrauss takes far too long to set the scene and deal the linesi dont want to hear about mystery and other characters 
a winsome epic unfolds in this story of survival in the congo and of the misplaced fanaticism which has such a devastating affect on all involved this story is beautifully written and the heartbeat of each character is deeply felt
i discovered this book just a few days after  this year  weve heard so many sad stories related to that awful event most of this book was not sad but there is sadness while the world was concentrating on the events in nyc  and  washington there was so much going on around gander newfoundland where dozens  of the planes from overseas landed its a story of how wonderful these canadians were as they welcomed fed bedded  and comforted travelers im not sure how many of us were thinking of those stranded passengers  and what about the animals travelling in the luggage compartments this is a book that deals with such a serious issue but made me feel good as i read it its a wonderful example of how the majority of us are really good peopleand that newfies are special
this rewrite of an older story is a vast improvement it has a rich flavor of new orleans under american protectorship and of the creole culture the heroine has spunk and is intelligent as well as tactful the hero is a powerful man who loves his family and has been thought a murderer for years behind the scenes currents and betrayal echo throughout the writing is done with a sense of humor as well great book
wallis pitches his book as an attempt to show that christians can be democrats or republicans or whatever presumably  here he is correct  he also pitches his argument as being nonpartisan  here he is mistaken it doesnt take too long to figure out his idea of nonpartisan is liberal democrat
an incedibly well written book his writing is unpretentious and honest he writes how a guy would think i made it through this book in one sitting  i look forward to reading more from him
great book with lots of twists and turns  one of jances very best  i read her books all the time and this one kept me guessing right until the very end
i just finished this book and i literally threw it across the room when completed the whole book i was groaning at the lack of anything in this bookspoilers spoilers spoilersi cant believe she killed the main character bad author bad shame on youseriously who does that and honestly i am not just mad about that unfortunate twist the entire book was written in a very passive voice she switched between four and tris every single chapter sometimes while i was reading the book i would think that tris was talking only to figure out it was actually four because of pronoun use the voice of four and the voice of tris were exactly the same it diminished the character four in a really poor way he became nothing more than a weak sniveling little boy instead of the sturdy brave twisted hero he was made out to be in the other books the romance between tris and four was weak in this book where the other two it was explosive there was little passion in this book between them and only a few failed romance scenes in which you are left with something to be desired the last few chapters of the book were painful to read as four snivels about the loss of his  year old girlfriend and mourns her loss that was the end of the book i can say that i was extremely disappointed the first two books were exciting brave boisterous and passionate this book fell short of that and into its own category of lame i wish there was a redo button for veronica roth to try again she obviously lost her love for this series before writing the conclusion would have preferred an unfinished series than the bitter taste this book left in my mouth
i have read the whole thing  it took me six monthsexcellent broadspectrum reference not only  spells i think  i didnt count them but also a detailed formulary and information on the theory of spellcraft  im looking forward to reading the element encyclopedia of witchcraft which is next on my list

breathless is not your typical dean koontz novel while the familiar brilliant writing style which pulls the reader into the story is present missing is the darkness that puts a fine edge to it all overall the book comes off as warm and fuzzy i kept expecting the mood to take a sudden turn toward the macabre  various despicable characters sprinkled throughout the tale held promise  but as i neared the final pages the realization that it wasnt going to happen left me a little disappointed the protagonists of the story grady adams and cammy rivers were rather passive throughout the book which could have been a product of the rather nebulous identity of the antagonist a government agency bent on containing information about a new species of angelic fuzzy animal that sort of popped into existence at the same time  im not sure if the two government programs were connected  another faction within the current regime had set into action a series of events aimed at turning the country into a state of chaos so the real heroes could have been the fuzzy creatures that sort of inadvertently triumphed over the evil governments of the worldwith the book mr koontz touches on topics of physics takes on darwinism and ends up offering hope for mankind what more could one ask for it is a fun read bob avey author of the detective elliot series

i reread divergent and insurgent to get ready for today woke up early to start reading went to the gym so i could keep readingthought the story was great loved seeing how they got out of the city and started to learn about the other groups around them enjoyed how tris and tobias had to actually work at their relationship and how to make their differences work the stuff about the bureau and the factions was interesting i was all inwhy three stars the ending i understand ms roth had to follow her muse and this was the way she felt it should end but why im so sad so pissed off that i spent so much time loving this series until the very end i dont ever want to read this book again and feel so hurt and betrayed by an authorim sure shes writing more and im interested to see her next stories however this ending is so disappointing i will definitely think twice before buying her next series
it makes me shudder to think parents can actually do these things to a child it is absolutely sickening but it is truly amazing how resiliant this woman became  i dont think i can ever understand how she could even remotely forgive these people
i will read it again and maybe again  ayn rand had a mind like no other  her characters are perfect and each fits into her story to last forever  the story line takes one into the world of architecture leaving not only a feeling of talent wonderment beauty and glory but also jealousy dishonesty manipulation and more above all it is a love story and a story of great accomplishment against all odds
this story gripped me from the first page it was disturbing and suspenseful it leaves you exhausted as if you were one of the characters in the book loved it
this is one of my favorite novels and crichton is a delightful author he confirms this with congo spehere eaters of the dead and so far timeline congo is about a team hired by a corporation to go out and find out what  tragedy fell upon a previous expedition theres plenty of action to keep  you wanting more and then enough to turn the page the movie cut out the  scene about the crashed airplane and threw in a love story which is  ashamed anyway do yourself a favor and read this book
i really enjoyed this book  it was equally as good as the first one difficult to put down would thoroughly recommend it  especially if you have read the first book in this series

this is a superb book on delhis history without the textbook type narrative that usually is associated with books like theseappreciating delhi is difficult for most nondelhi wallahs for the ostentatious ways and too aggressive nature of its modern day denizensbut having read this book is like lifting the screen to see a much more beautiful and unbelievably long past of the city to date a citys history till that long back is truly an amazing feat shown by dalrymple heredalrymple gives comprehensive and unbiased accounts from the citys birth to it present day status toggling between anecdotes of his own experiences in the city in doing so he succeeds in bringing out the secret lives of the eunuchs passionate pigeon fights in old delhi the wild rule of william fraser in the jungles of mehrauli the frivolous codes of the decorum practiced in mughal period the popularity of the sufi saints and their powers and much more to help you envisage the rich heritage of the city
i dont know who the bubbly cutesy writing style is supposed to appeal to but it certainly isnt me  i cant say i enjoyed reading this book and i skim read a lot of itthat said it did give me information in easily understood terms  so i had to give it  starsif you read it and think buddhism and mindfulness might warrant more reading may i suggest anything by thich nhat hanh a zen master from vietnam who lives in france and is second only to the dalai lama as a buddhist leader

warning some spoilers i finally finished the book i can breathe a sigh of well earned relief i no longer have to worry about getting near the internet and accidentally reading a spoiler all in all as usual i am left unsatisfied by the book not because it lacks quality or because it lacks anything really it is just that i wish more could have happenedi would happily trade  that useless page describing the shield hall for one more of dany learning to ride her dragon i would be ever so glad to to have spent a little more time with  theon as he and jeyne escaped winterfell rather than the massive pile of back story pages i would desperately like to understand  where in the sam hell the arya stark story is  going that poor girl has been on a journey that deserves a rest

unfortunately herbert somehow fails to capture the imagination in the ghosts of sleath as much as he does in most of his other books the story centres around psychic investigator david ash who delves into mysterious events that are terrorizing the community of sleath where he comes across a dark character called phelan though the premise of the book is sound and though there are solid descriptions somehow herbert doesnt quite capture the imagination maybe its that word solid that gives the cluenone of herberts books could be called weak and id like to give this one threeandahalf stars but the ghosts of sleath doesnt quite come up to the spendid pagegripping terror that this author is well capable of dont let that put you off either this book or james herbert because its still darn good reading

this is one of the greatest science fiction books ever written most of the reviewers and i agree on that id like to point out three areas that make this book special   characterszelazny gives us a range of characters that we can love sympathize with and suffer with sam of course for me though sugatathe assassin turned enlightened one was even more real and powerful yama the deathgod was in many ways the real hero everfaithful tak  i could go on the point is that each of these characters is fully developed and realized this isnt a one dimensional book the plot  its exciting yet complex the use of flashbacks makes it hard to follow from time to time you have to read this more than once but its big and it draws you in you want sam to win even when you know he cant the religionthe intellectual and moral battle as well as the physical and magical battles between hinduism and budhism are so compelling that i researched both religions after reading thisi just reread lord of light all right im not sure what number it is any more and its every bit as powerful as it was when i first read it decades ago  zelaznys bestand thats saying a lot

when i looked inside it was a book with picturesits a childrens story totally dissatisfied and now to figure out another gift for my granddaughter
my  year old boy loves this book  it is one of his favorites right now he wants to read it every night

i was concerned at first when i purchased all the books the reviews for the third volume were way less complimentary having read all the books i can see why some people may not have liked book  if youre completely entranced by book  and you want to just have life be exactly what you thought it was when you first entered divergent feel free to stay there be deluded that everything is what you think it is but life is never like that its never just one layer deepwhether were talking about the internal or the external world life is more complicated than you thought so if you like being challenged to see a much bigger pictureone that wobbles and shakes and is most likely going to betray youthen dig into book  its more tragic and yet more real life than you might have expected and it was worth all the investment id made into reading the divergent series besides humanity isnt much different now from any then you choose in history or future and humanity will keep making the same mistakes but its still worth living
numerology is not nearly as popular as tarot or palm reading because it involves  ick numbers  those of us who are rightbrained enough to enjoy the intuitive arts were probably not all that good at math in school  however this book is a great addition no pun intended to everyones metaphysical libraryi bought the book on a whim knowing nothing about numerology and not being especially psychic  soon i found myself doing startling accurate predictions for everyone in my workplace  im not sure if i just knew my coworkers that well probably not because i was also accurately describing their kids whom id never met or if i made good guesses or what  but i can say that my numerological experiments were easy and a lot of fun because of this bookbasically you need your subjects full name as printed on a birth certificate  each letter of the alphabet has a numeric value from  to  so the name carol will add up to a different number than the name carole so even though a name sounds one way you cant make an assumption that it follows the most common spelling  youll also need your subjects birthdate  then you just do simple arithmetic the book will show you the alphabettonumber correspondence until you end up with one number from  to  that describes a persons life path desity soul personality and maturity  you can stop there or venture into the more detailed readings shown in the advanced chapters where you map out yours or others major cycles pinnacles and challenges and karmic lessonsi predicted that one coworkers son would become his generations donald trump or bill gates he had the most amazing numerological profile  all s so well see  in the meantime i recommend this book  as an aside i got interested enough in numerology that i tried about six other books many of which were equally comprehensive but none were as userfriendly as this one
  breathtaking   excellent   good   flawed   badfirst ive got to point out that if a book has made it into its rd edition it must have something to offer all those readers who are keeping it in print  i personally found this book to be written with great respect and encouragement for new witches everywhereit touches on almost everything connected with wicca each chapter serves as a solid grounding in its topic and a jumpingoff place for more studyyou get chapters on witches in history sabbats and esbats the lord and the lady covens and solitaries magical tools and costumes the seasons of nature the phases of the moon astrology dreams divination how to write your own spells herb magic candle magic color magic altars magic circles familiars pentacles and morethe authors write in a clear inviting friendly style the information is so wellorganized that only later do you realize what an exhausting amount youve covered throughout the authors serve as guides anticipating and steering you clear of pitfalls such as ingesting unknown herbs or attempting to interfere with anyones free willmy one disappointment in the book concerns its title its really about wicca and does no more than mention other types of witchcraft in a brief historical summary but i still found it a rich offering to pagans everywhere
eighteen yearold sabriel lives at a boarding school in ancelstierre a mundane world that seems reminiscent of england or australia in the early twentieth century  across the nearby wall and garrison that mixes medieval and wwiera weapons and uniforms lies the old kingdom place of anarchy and magic where technology will not worksabriel gets a message that something has happened to her father a famous necromancer  she a necromancerintraining must go into the old kingdom and rescue him  on the way she is helped by a chaotic spirit and a prince who has slept for  yearsthe author has a pure and pareddown writing style like leguins in earthsea  also his magic is believable on the earthsea level in its realism  the complexity of its details and the simplicity of its description  charter magic is like the tao or the forcethe necromancy has the chilling gates and precincts one passes through in the land of the dead and the different bells used by necromancers to manipulate the dead  in addition the military stuff of ancelstierre forms a pleasing contrast with the magic old kingdom

wowmike hits a homerun right outta the ballpark  too bad the politics and corruption and selfserving bs he writes of werent on that same ballthis is a great book  besides doing a lot of venting about whats wrong with our democracy and w and his ilk are not the only targets here he also provides useful ways to get involved with the system if youre just as upset as he isthe venting is also good  besides being unapologetically honest its also funny  i read most of this book while commuting to work in the morning and my cocommuters mustve been wondering why i was laughing so hardhis chapter on how hes been disrespected by more white people than people of color is also an eyeopener  but mike dont think its all hugs and kisses if youre a person of color  im an asian american whos spent most of the last  decades working with both white people and people of color in professional and activism settings  let me tell you

great book
well written and comprehensive coverage of an important period in turkeys history the description of the  gallipoli campaign is very vivid and heartrending considering the futile waste of life on both sides should be read by every student of history
very poor and disappointing certainly not worth the money very amateur and poorly writteni noticed it didnt get any reviews from the press or any other organization
well deserved to be a best seller
perfect
this book kept my interest from the first page to the last i could relate to the characters it reminded me a lot of my favorite author lynn harris  im looking forward to the sequel

we love to cook  but this is a pretty serious book  i almost feel like you need to pretty much be a professional cook to do the majority of the recipes  and the products you would need to buy is also on that scale  it takes some studying to get through a recipe  the recipes are amazing but may not be something for just cooking up a meal at home
great book the stories stand alone but all take place in the same town looking forward to more from these authors
received a copy of her new book and will say the followingbr br sarah is a first time published author and reading the book cover to cover i was touched by real poetry nothing cryptic in the sense of trying to decipher meanings moreover nothing that is cliche she set a standard on the way poetry really should be presented through the heart in my reading she left easter eggs that spread delight like patches of light going through a dense canopy when you come across such light in midwalk you stop just to appreciate the contrast and to finalize she does save the best for last which will remain lasting for me i do hope she continues to produce such fantastic work in the years to come
stupid wars is a nonfiction tome that is very well written and researched about the wars that went on from early ancientbiblical times to the modern world of today that were complete and utter failuresthis book is very funny and entertaining with a satirical tone to many of the chapters the author also gave background information on what happened prior to beginning of each conflict and what went on after them this book contains multipage stories and tales of some not very mentioned or important at all wars and battles throughout history it gives condensed retellings at many points during reading this book i found myself thinking do you not know your history or yeah that seemed like a good idea a good book for a rainy afternoon read
i purchased this book and held onto it for many years before finally reading it the story starts off okay but as the book and characters progress i found myself not believing that this book was about vampires or romance they are sparsely mentioned and the plot follows to be a snoozer the romance scenes are stilted as if the characters are completely unsure of who they are the entire book is very convoluted and confusing as it is really difficult to keep track of any events and people it is poorly written and i questioned how it ever got to print with so many errors in grammar spelling and flowthru the dialog and what little romance this book contains despite the authors attempts to paint a time period supposedly s falls very short its almost like the entire thing was slapped together in a mad rush to the publisher this is definitely not an author i would read again i was only to happy to finish and donate this book
as an avid historybuff and reader of all things that didnt make it into the history books i found this book very entertaining and it gets reread on occasion each sections provides lists on all  states plus lists about presidents arts popular culture and morebr br some of my favorite lists arebr br   significant differences between    in americabr   nicknames of  american presidentsbr  heinzs  varietiesbr   myths about the vietnam warbr  the last words of  us presidentsbr   presidential burial placesbr br this is a great fun to read and you are almost certain to learn something about how we became the country and people we are very easy to read
i received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewbr since i am from new orleans and the gulf coast area i thought this would be a great book for me i like the revolutionary period so when i read the blurb i was eager to start reading it i started reading it from the moment i got itbr but i couldnt stay in it the book just didnt have the staying power the characters were enjoyable but kind of two dimensional while i truly wanted lyse to rise above her circumstances i didnt feel compelled to read the story to see if she would i did enjoy her change of heart regarding the revolutionary way but with her personality it was expectedbr rafe was an interesting character only because of the intrigue surrounding him even that wore off rather quickly i couldnt understand the romance between rafe and lyse barely a spark there and she pines over him waiting for months at a timebr the action in the book was very choppy there were moments when it would speed up and keep me engrossed and then it would abruptly slow down and completely lose mebr overall this book was a mild romance whose action was very choppy and barely kept me engaged however others may like it
i received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review you dont see many people with two doctorates each in such differing fields of study that it is almost laughable but here we have an author who holds doctorates in theology and in astrophysics normally people pick one side of the fence to be on either faith or science however the author is probably one of the best equipped to truly straddle the fence and be able to say that science really does uphold faithbr this book was broken down into only a few chapters which made each of the chapters rather lengthy and almost cumbersome to read i would have liked to see a few more chapters in it just to make me feel like ive done more progress instead of taking an hour or three to get through one chapter that being said the author does a very thorough job in explaining the theories behind how people currently think god works in their lives old science theories about how god uses science to work in peoples lives and current science theories that can show how god can move in peoples lives without being a flood and famine overbearingly obvious type of godbr i found this book to be a very thorough book in presenting the evidence and arguments the author has a relatively easy scientific form of writing that i found to be enjoyable he broke up the almost textbook writing with a few personal anecdotes and humor if you have a logical scientific brain like mine and struggle wiuth seeing how god could exist in this world you will enjoy this book
in the same way that a good defense attorney creates doubt in the jurors minds these merchants know how to insert doubt in the publics minds from ddt to acid rain to smoking to the hole in the ozone layer and now to climate change these scientists for hire created enough doubt to delay the necessary regulations for decades in each case their actions are effectively criminal considering the deaths that have resulted from their nefarious activities for which they got well paid
i received a free copy of this book in exchange for a review my opinions are my ownbr br i really enjoyed this book easy fast read flowed along nicely with something constantly happening clean and safe for age  and up has a definite ending with room for the sequel to follow all the characters had their own personality and faults that made them unique to the story the kids in the story talked and acted like kids no one suddenly became a superhero overnightbr br i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good book to sit back and relax with
ive been using this book for less than a week and so far my back feels better  im cautiously optomistic well see how this works in the long run
it was everything that i expected fast service arrived in perfect condition and the price was extremely reasonable i would do it again just to have the experience all over again
great for review

the dessert recipes are amazing  prior to this i have only made healthy whole plant food cookies with bananas or applesauce and they just tast like mushbr i have made the chocolate chip cookies granola bars and almond fudge my kids and husband even like them people are shocked its healthy and i have never had that reactionbr as an aside i prefer chocolate chip cookies with unsweetened shredded coconut instead of chocolate chips so deliciousbr i have been amazed
i received an international edition despite the cover depicted which is the edition for use in the us while this deception is not expected to affect my coursework i do believe others should be warned that this could happen had i known this information prior to my purchase i would not have bought the book
this book was such a fun read ive been waiting for this book ever since reading the first two and it definitely doesnt disappoint so if you were a fan of the first two books then this is a must read
this book was not exactly pocket size like the regular version unless you mean takes up the entire side pocket and in that case it is also doesnt include the mechanism of action of any of the drugs which is unfortunate the font is also larger which is what makes the book so much bigger if it were the same size as the regular version the book would probably be a much more portable size
great book the seller provided the book in a timely fashion and it was exactly as describedbr br while elizabeth gilbert might not continue to follow the lessons she learned on her spiritual journey the book is still worthwhile and provides a great world perspective on how to find peace gilbert seeks this peace due to a failed relationship and other heartaches she travels the world as a writer for a magazine to learn how different cultures and places can help her learn to love herself and to find forgiveness
after watching the movie i knew that i just had to read the book everyone knows that books are better than the movies unfortunately this is absolutely the farthest thing from the truth do not waste the money on the book buy the movie i cannot begin to tell you how disappointed i was the worst parti finished the dang book it had to be karma for something because it was torture
everyone needs to read this book sonia is so extremely descriptive as she tours all types of farms around the world  and though she is empathetic emotion is often left out which allows readers to come to conclusions on their own based on the facts when a career  financeindustry obsessed sonia is laid off from her job on wall street she thinks volunteering on an organic dairy farm will be a nice enjoyable break from city what she discovers cows chained to their stalls with electric prods looming overhead surprises and inspires her to continue this journey of digging deeper into the bowels of factory farming the truth is sad and shocking but so important for all of us to be aware of so we can make better decisions in regards to what we eat and where we buy our meat anyone whos curious to learn more about animal agriculture labelling of animal foods and solutions to leading a more sustainable life absolutely must read this book i couldnt put it down huge thanks to sonia for risking her life and shedding a light on this massive problem our world is facing  we all need to be aware and take action in some way shape or form
very impressed with the whole book  great recommendations and super recipes
i like the images but it does have a lot of teenytiny lines to fill which could be more stressful than this activity is supposed to be
i just read jena lee nardellas new book one thousand wells and could hardly put it down what a story she has to tell as a yearold she had the courage  commitment to cofound a nonprofit to bring clean water to  people in africa this is such an inspiring professional and personal story of building  wells and how jena slowly by slowly worked through the challenges along the way
great drug book
very good but i wish id seen the premier review book st which comes with a disk  online access for a wider variety of tools to help you study and for only a few dollars more
there is some good investigative work here but cox is too concerned with trying to limit the guilt for the lynching to the group of six killers while going easy on the rest of the community for much of the book it feels that neal is on trial whereas the community that killed him gets a free and even sympathetic ride coxs account of scottsboro is a joke as is his apparent assumption that marianna would have given neal a free trial cox also omits any analysis of the previous scholarly account by james mcgovern which remains the only book that places the crime in its true context
i was gifted my copy by my sisterinlaw who works for a different network marketing company once i opened it i couldnt put it down this book is everything i love my company and my work and ive always believed in what we are doing but now the confidence that i have in speaking about this business model has skyrocketed i can go up to any wall street banker working  hours a week and making  and tell them with complete confidence that what heshe is doing is ludicrous and what im building with my company is brilliant ive since purchased dozens of copies for friends my consultants etc and have hundreds of people on my team who have done the same its a mustread with our fast growing team i couldnt love this book more you girls nailed it

came in great shape after using it for a bit the pages started falling out
i have been using this book for the last  years and thought it about time i wrote a review on it  this book is by far the best baking book i have ever come across  i have cooked a lot of the recipes in this book and have never had  a single recipe fail  better still the recipes are all so easy that i rarely even bother with an electric mixer most of them i simply use a spoon to mix them  i cannot recommend this book highly enough to anyone looking for an egg free baking book or someone who wants a simple easy to follow reliable book of cake baking
we used several recipes on a three day hike and the meals were more satisfying than typical trail food we dehydrated our own vegetables and easily incorporated them into the standing recipes
great book to cover the basics and also more advanced tips nicely organized and friendly enough not to be intimidating while informative enough to benefit those with experience
can we call it a book
zickermans humorous style makes this book fun to read even though you are reading a book about pain otherwise known as working out he is right on the money about weight training verses aerobics tons of personal success stories are very motivating
im reading backwardsmurder in greenwhich and the book on the oj simpson murders are in my bookshelf but i havent yet read themalthough mark fuhrman has the ego of john douglas and though he really interfered obnoxiously in the police investigation his descriptions of finding murder victims set my hair on end i couldnt sleep the night i read it i think fuhrman is an excellent writer perhaps its best he resigned his detective position his details research thoughts were all quite excellent i would recommend this book to anyone interested in true crime
the story is touching and has a nice message  however the garish ugly busy pictures undermine the impact of the story  imagine what this book would have been like if wendell minor had done the illustrations instead the illustrations with their dreadful colors and awful images confuse and alienate children who are the assumed target audience  this will not be a book a child would be naturally drawn to and would stay on most library shelves which is unfortunate since the story is so delightful
i lived the st two novels in this series but this one was a slow read it was hard to stay interested and are you kidding with the ending  come on
yes the fountainhead remains at the very top of my list of best novels ever written along with atlas shrugged the characters may be a bit less developed by ms rand than in gatsby however it is an inspirational and motivational work timeless in its message
i gave goddess five stars because of the indepth research and actual number of source quotes that validated this particular bio on marilyn monroes life it is not a book that flows chronologically but rather by source those sources were all very believable especially with the detailed quotes from close friends husbands and colleagues for those still wondering how marilyn died anthony summers does an excellent job detailing her life and especially final days best of all he lives you with three possible scenarios and the incredible incompetence and mishandling of her death and autopsy compelling read
i cannot remember when i have been as disappointed with the end of a book or series as i am with allegiant nor do i understand why veronica roth would write this ending with the divergent movie due out soon  she has devalued her franchise  left no way for it to recover  maybe she had grown tired of the characters because she did not even bother to give them separate voices  sometimes i had to glance back at the beginning of a chapter to see if tris or tobias was speaking  their voices were that indestinct  gloom was the pervasive mood of the book  the pace of the book was testudinarian  read divergent  insurgent then write your own ending
ive read three of gregorys novelsthe queens fool a novel boleynthe other boleyn girl andthe virgins lover boleyn  out of the threethe queens fool a novel boleynis my favorite  its a thrilling masterpiece depicting a young womans coming of age colliding with the tumultuous politics of her uncertain timehannah green a young jewish woman flees the spanish inquisition with her father to find herself entangled in a battle for the british throne  soon after her arrival in england the powerful few discovers her gift of prophesy and tries to exploit it  as a result hannah is torn between the treacherous politics and religious upheaval of the tudor era a time where loyalties shifted from one moment to the next a time where carrying the wrong version of the bible could quickly lead to a hot date with the gallowswhat i love about this book is how gregory weaves a historical period with factual figures into a tale told through the believable eyes of a fictional character  i cared very much about hannah her vulnerabilities as a trusting young woman her personal sacrifices and her safety  hannah not only has to deal with the political forces pulling her in multiple directions but she also grapples with the growing pains of becoming a young adultgregory expertly crafted a book that will keep you reading into the wee hours of the nightif you sleep at all  if you enjoyed readingthe other boleyn girl youll love the queens fool  and if this is youre first glimpse into gregorys work youre in for a treat
its been some time since id last read a novel by dean koontz  and as for previous work by him this novel was written in the usual koontz fashion  the novel follows multiple characters the upright moral ones the seedy ones with struggling consciences the deranged antagonist impeding on the protagonists trail and the various other characters that add flavor to the plot of the story  even though the story has its formulaic tendencies it does have entertainment value and offers an optimistic view of the future of humankindthe story builds up to centrally focus on the existence of two exceptional beingssuch as to suggest that humanity is on the brink of a new era  the novel deals with this concept in a skilled mannerthough way too late  the first half of the book seems a bit trivial to the point of bringing me to near boredom  the storyline of the deranged antagonists one a twin brother with grotesque intentions and the other a demented wandererdoesnt seem to really add anything to the story  it wasnt until i was over halfway through the book that the there was edge and suspense to keep me reading  i was left wishing that the book could have developed more of the storyline dealing with the veterinarian cammy and her friend grady who ultimately befriend and protect the beings who we learn a little too late are the central characters in the storydespite the shortcomings of the book late development and frivolous storylines the last quarter of the book makes worthwhile reading  theres a sense of enlightenment with the characters which would have been more profound had the storyline been developed much more sooner in the book  and the storyline didnt tend to grab me till near the end  i couldnt say i would recommend this book at its full price but perhaps it would be a good read at a bargain price
one choice canand will change everything in the conclusion of the divergent series the place that tris tobias and the rest of their people have called home for decades is now keeping them prisoner locked away from the outside world that the divergent are apparently supposed to save kept from the truth for so long tris and her friends are determined to discover what is really out there and what their purpose is but the truth is bigger than they realize and they must decide what they are going to do with the dangerous and life changing information given to them with pain loss heartbreak and sacrifice clogging their past and present who will they trust and what truth will they believe to help them journey into their futureallegiant possesses many positive qualities that are very similar to the previous two books tension between people groups that have differing views of how their city should operate relationship issues and improvements between tris and tobias and personnel journeys that each character goes through just to name a few the growth of the characters are wonderful and roth does a great job of not making perfect characters
ive watched the showtime series the tudors ive read bios of henry viii i read diarmaid maccullochs book thomas cranmer which i highly recommend for a detailed depiction of what happened step by step to change catholic england to church of england england but so many of the figures remained shadowythe c j sansom mystery series has gone a long way to provide the flavor of the tudor years theres even a sense of thomas cromwell in action in the initial volume dissolutionthen along comes wolf hall this book fleshes out thomas cromwell and shows him in relation to all those other shadowy figures what were just names are becoming a bit more corporal in my imaginationwhat i especially liked about this book is that sir thomas more the sainted one becomes much more corporal we see the carnal cruel man he might possibly have really been when seen without historys halobut still what did thomas cromwell doevery thing ive read gives the impression that hes busy busy busy and wolf hall provides a good sense of the pace of cromwells life but i still had that feeling of insubstantiality what exactly kept cromwell so busyrecently i came across a book by g r elton its got a horrible title policy and police that doesnt do justice to the richness within the content concerns itself with describing how a central decision popish ways out henry as religious leader in and bytheway anne is now queen was enforced throughout the realmthis is done through anecdotes with liberal quotes from testimony as well as excerpts from written documents the examples of the english language in tudor times is endlessly enjoyablefinally i have a sense of what cromwell had to do on a day to day basis and was apparently doing so well i begin to understand why henry came to regret the execution of this man how did that happeni wait for the followup to wolf hall to get further illunination on thomas cromwell
rough justice is little more than an exercise in exaggerated formulaic writing all of ms scottolines characters are two dimensional caricatures the heros are all female the villains are all male the situations overreach and are scarcely believable the interactions between male and female characters are so misandrous that even male children are portrayed as mean spirited dishonest and corrupt the primary antagonists are shown to be either murderers brutes and  malicious malefactors of one kind or another or utterly emasculated wimps with nothing better to do than fetch baby formula and cower before the tirades of other overbearing males i found this book to be shallow uninteresting and fundamentally bereft of any redeeming value i would not recommend reading it to anyone except perhaps those who share ms scottolines investment in misandry
i wish the author had spent more time researching things such as the organization and operations of the delta force weapons submarines etcim not complaining about the science or the plot im complaining about the impossible action sequences spoiler its impossible for anybody to swim under the ice cap in the way one character does in this book

carl honores account of his adventures within the slow movement is an invaluable primer for those who are looking for a thorough and accessibly written introduction to and examination of the slow philosophyoriginally precipitated by his desire to regain some sense of equipoise in an increasingly frenetic career as a harried london journalist honore journeyed all over the world and interviewed various adepts of those who have decided to live their lives around the concept of la tempo giusto from tantric sex workshops in london and slow housing cooperatives in japan to transcendental urbanist suburbs in the us and arguably the cradle of the movements conception in the town of bra italy birthplace of the slow food movement honores book is a persuasive good humoured and cogently argued polemic against the hyperkinetic twentyfourseven culture that has only succeeded in alienating dehumanising and degrading the quality of our lives health and environments in western secular society honore provides plenty in the way of empirical statistical and anecdotal evidence to back up his case while its not the best book on the movement ever written its certainly a good place to start if youre slowly familiarising yourself with the concepts that said i would personally recommend idler alumnus tom hodgkinsonshow to be idle a loafers manifestoover this
no defined plot  it is like she didnt know what to do with the characters and the whole book just falls flat  one thing i never do is peek at the ending of a book but with this one i did i was a little over half way through and so bored i needed to know if i should keep reading so i took a peek through the rest of the book and got the gist of what happensit was such a letdown i just tossed it aside and will not pick it up again  i preread a lot of books for the middle school i work in so i read a lot of junkthis was below that
this book focuses on what the war in afghanistan is like for the combat troops who fight it everyday  in my view the author presents a mostly objective look at the way of life of american troops fighting the taliban  the book is written as a progression of anecdotes and stories about a small unit of soldiers both their daytoday existence and the adrenaline dripping combat itself  the author seems to have really captured what combat is like and portrayed it in a way for the average person to start to understand  this book is not cheerleading for the us army but it does give you an appreciation for the sacrifices our soldiers make  i highly recommend this book on its own merits but also as a way to remind us of our troops that are in harms way on a daily basis  the only aspect of the book that was weak was the authors attempt to analyze the psychology of combat and try to tie it to the theory of evolutionit just didnt seem to fit
in the fountainhead ayn rand presents her philosophy of objectivism told through the lives of her characters  the protagonist is architect howard roark who portrays the epitome of the heroic individual standing against mediocrity  the villain is media figure ellsworth toohey who is known for raising up what is insignificant and tearing down what is excellent  dont be surprised if many of the events and dialogue in this book rings true in regard to current eventsi read atlas shrugged before fountainhead and found atlas shrugged to be much more compelling and a better presentation of rands philosophy  fountainhead is still worth reading but is not quite as good
i picked up this book after hearing it discussed by dr david allen white following the tragic collapse of the minneapolis bridge in   events like that cause us to askwhy do tragedies like this happen  why did the bridge fallin this book the author sets up the same question but set in the s in lima peru  a bridge has collapsed causing the death of  souls  was it fate was it gods will were they good souls or bad souls  the author never answers the question but seems to indicate that it is not an answerable question this side of eternity  this is a short intriguing novel with an important question even though a little slow moving at times
i must apologize in advance for giving such an important work of literature  stars  this book is unquestionably one of the greatest works of literature  i have no criticism for the book in that regardthis book was entertaining at times and very innovative  it was full of humor drama and bits of wisdom  however it left me bored after the first few hundred pages  i kept with the book to the end but it was hard to keep trucking since it seemed to be much of the same thing over and over again  also i ended up enjoying don quixotes sidekick sancho panza more that don quixote himself  this is definitely one case where id recommend an abridged version over the full version  for this book there is no need to read the full  pages as half that much would do the trick
thank you justice thomas for writing such a moving and informative memoir  unfortunately all most americans know about justice thomas comes from the overly political and salacious senate confirmation hearings  it was amazing to see the history of such an important american leader starting with his small town segregated beginnings to his appointment to the supreme court  this man struggled and he is honest about his shortcomings and his personal growth  he is transparent and instructive in his transformation from a young angry liberal to the conservative jurist that he is today  his stories about how his grandfather raised him and shaped him are very moving  some already have their mind made up about thomasfor all others this book is well worth your while  one of the best memoirs ive read in a long time
teddy roosevelt wasand remainsmr wildlife conservation this segment of his life certainly makes for a booklength topicbut not  hardcopy pages mr brinkley splits most of his infinitives and he belabors many of his finer points he also embeds in his text many of his contemporary bibliographical references which would be best left to end notes padding aside brinkleys work is a valuable contribution to american conservation and a worthy hommage to tr muir and the other pioneers of the movement brinkley also underscores trs streak of hypocrisy and the presidents difficulty in reconciling bully manly virtue with conservationto roosevelt
this is my favorite novel of all time  its much better than the movie as is the case with most novels adapted for film  i didnt want it to end

while this book is obviously long  pages for the stubby paperback there is so much going that progress thru the book moves quickly think of bobby shaftoe as a combined forrest gump and john mcclain die hard rolled into one starting with lawrence waterhouse and alan turing in the new jersey pine barrens  minutes from my place of residence and going to present day jungles in the philippines and many characters transversing the globe this book has alot going for it code breakers during world war  enigma set out to keep each other on ones collective toes company executives for epiphyte in the present work to get a complicated internet system established the chapters go back and forth and are connected with the relatives and offspring of l waterhouse pastrandy waterhousepresent  bobby shaftoe pastamydouglas macarthur shaftoe present a number of scenes are beyond hilarious with bobby being ask to open the crates on the ship with an axeno spoilers here and goto dengo tring to remember a message to the corporals family keep this book going while the people in the book are brilliant the technical aspects and code breaking math are made simple and occupy little of the story why they all do it is interesting other reviews ive read seem to pick on one thing and thats the fact that most of the characters refer to japan and the japanese as nips or nipponese maybe in  but a lawyer in the present would not tell randy he should get a hold of sonypanasonic or some other nipponese company also one review said there was too much profanity and gratuitous relationsnot in the book i read all of us want great reading  but b shaftoe would not know about a casbah in algiers or la pasyon art finding out why the guys randyavitomedthe dentist go thru all the trouble they do makes for a wonderful read sorta like its a mad

the dance of fear is the book formerly known as fear and other uninvited guests the name change most likely came as the result of author harriet lerners other dance book titles  dance of anger dance of intimacy dance of deception and so onlerner uses her experiences patients experiences and other peoples experiences  a valuable way to teach what fear is as it has many meanings and situations that bring it on she doesnt throw do this out there or make claims youll get past your fear in one day instead
this is a pet dog that doesnt make you sneeze or itch it doesnt shed or have fleas best of all it doesnt bite or do its business on the carpet parents can gladly get this pet for children of course this book would never take the place of a real thing but its a pleasure to read it i can read it repeatedly as children always want you to do and not get tired of it a parent cant help but get into character while reading the book aloudthe books insides have a felt  velvet feel so it gives the child something to touch it has a leash that can act as a bookmark or make it easy to walk the dog the illustrations are colorful and well done adults and children will laugh and enjoy this onethe author does a superb job with his play on words big frog means big

this is a prequel to john christophers excellent tripod series which i remember being the best science fiction series i could find as a young adolescent  even as an adult the series stands as well written and certainly worth reading  when i was younger though i always wondered how the tripods took over the earth  at the time i did not know about this book actually it hadnt been written yet  so as an adult when i found the original series and decided to reread them having the same question i stumbled upon this bookthis book covers that story and the initial beginning of the settlement at the white mountains it begins when lauries sister becomes obsessed with a tv show and disappears only to reappear later on talking about these aliens and how they are going to bring peace to earth  later more and more people disappear and reappear and the beginning of the caps from the tripods series start showing upthis book often lacks the urgency of the initial series
incredibly moving and well written book  i finished it lin one sitting

divine intelligence is arguably one of the most important books of the st century as it showcases the universal search for meaning through the story of a modern man named dan  and the lens of neuroscience dan struggles with the internal conflict he feels between living the life society tells him he should live and the life he senses he could live if only he knew how using a narrative style dr jayne gardner takes the reader through dans journey as he struggles to discover what truly matters to him and what no longer makes sense never preachy and welldocumented by gardners extensive professional experience and research in neuroscience divine intelligence provides an accessible point of entry for readers looking to expand their understanding of spirituality and god in a hightech sciencebased world
this is probably one of the best  most recent under the radar comics ive come across this past year i wasnt all that familiar with the character outside of some brief images i recall when eclipse comics rebooted this character in the early s but it basically ended there this new series from dynamite is outstanding in terms of story  art direction terror of the zombie queen introduces the bleak  pulp world of the spider with a varied cast  even cooler villians this character who was conceived in  has been modernized in the vein of suspenseful neo film noir with staggering illustrations by colton worley david liss spins an addictive yarn nothing short of super heroics this side of batman or daredevil with plenty of hard boiled shadows  brooding panels where the droplets of rain seem like they almost want to bleed through the pages while theyre are some similarities with our hero close to the shadow green hornet  even batman this is still very much a different beast with only the pulp aesthetic falling into place with these other masked mystery men seriously a very cool read with beautiful illustrations  a fresh alternative to the big two highly recommended
another great read from the winning duo of david liss  colton worley because i enjoyed it so much i picked this up along with their other work on dynamites the spider here once again we get an excellent brooding  action packed story arc of veteran vigilante the shadow in modern times facing a grim  powerful new threat im glad that dynamites reintroduced this character with various comic books to introduce him to new audiences  show just why hes so cool i love david liss grasp on these characters  colton worleys artwork is nothing short of awesome think alex ross meets esad ribic
what a thrill the grandchildren received when they discovered the covers mentioned their names  found the books delightful
comprehensive a bit technical
i love this stuff

excellent finally a pregnacyt book for men from a very male perspective great insight and advice from one man to another  personal and to the point perspective i appreciate the authors candid maleness and how he offers up compassion but keeps his needs in tact every to be daddyhusband would benefitand their women
this is a really cute book for girls or kids of any age but especially preteens it encourages us all to be happy with who we are instead of fitting a mold  the rhyming gives it a fun feel and the clever name changes of name brands are really funny so it doesnt come off as being preachy or overthetop  i read this book at the beginning of a new school year to a group of  year old girls who really enjoyed it  this would be great to read in a classroom as well
it is a beautiful book and one id be proud to display on my coffee table
when i was reading this book i felt like i was being showered with blessings i hung on to each word knowing what a privilege it is to learn the life story of such a holy person in this book the reader gets to know shree maa a true living saint through a collection of interviews with her there are even fascinating accounts of her childhood this is a book i enjoyed reading so much that i will definitely read it again and again if you would like to feel closer to god i highly recommend this book

my  year old and  year old enjoyed this book from a parents point of viewim on the fence about how i feel about it this story has a ton of run on sentences horrible grammar a few cuss wordsthere is talk about alcoholism and an absent mother if you have a sensitive child this book might not be for them it did teach the concept of love what you have while you have it and it does have a cute story line about a loving dog
an essential book really essential
i had purchased these because the art included was terrifying come to find these are a new art style rendering the stories significantly less scary granted i did not realize this was a new edition so its my fault still this set is weak

ive read all of todd borgs books and tahoe blue fire might just be his best yet  i cant put my finger on exactly why  its certainly a top notch thrilling suspenseful mystery that keeps you moving through the storybut this one has a different rhythm  while traveling along in the story what seems to be nondescript bits and pieces show themselves then settle back into the story to simmer  eventually there are a number of bits and pieces blending and foaming picking up the pace and bringing you close to an epiphany but not quite  its like having something on the tip of your tongue but unable to retrieve it  its maddening but exciting  then theres the part of the rhythm that allows you to savor  the characters the place the history the story  there has to be an inordinate amount of time dedicated to research in this book  thats a real enjoyment of the book and all of todds books so many fascinating topics and information given during conversations and the story movement itselfbr with living in the tahoe area ive always enjoyed tracking owen mckennas travels i often look on an area map to see where the description takes me  so you can imagine my delight when owen came to my hometown of carson city what fun to find him  blocks from a dear friends housebr if you havent read any of todd borgs books your are missing some great read time start with this one  no need to do them in order besides this is a gem
not worth the price information and pictures does not do justice to the actual scenery habitat and wildlife we want to return this item
this book is excellent it depicts in great detail the missions its history and features buy this as a keepsake and a guide when you plan to bucket list visiting all of them

investigative reporting by a top senior reporter  nontechnical survivalist view of a technical subject a solid reportorial account of the vulnerability of the nations electrical network  underreporting about the technical aspects of this vulnerability such as scada systems covered survivalists and the emergency preparations of the mormon church in much greater detail than was necessary but a thoroughly technodisaster storytelling project and entertaining reading
was in decent condition
clear and easy to read
this was bought for someone else

excellent book well written and thoroughly documented
received on time and was exactly as portrayed
here is my  mangaupdates reviewbr akiras over the top art is good and the serious humor works fine for the about  volumes but i now had enough after flipping through the next  volumes as i couldnt see anything to stick around but the series was fairly decent while the joke lasted the prison arc actually concludes after a while but the following scenario isnt that hot no pun intended or original all in all prison school is nothing phenomenal but at least the its a clear comedy and not a porno not a lot of hard ecchi titles can say that but its a shame that the author had to kill me and the devil blues which started to really get goingbr update i flipped through the recent stuff due to the expose the series got after the kodansha win an in house award and the anime but the third arc is just the first one again with clear focus on sm  watersports so the series had been reduced to a harem porno only the characters further became deeply unsympathetic and the narrative is weirdly cruel and exploitative so i can only recommend again to drop the series after the first arc and to read the comparable and equality awardwinning ping pong club  instead jigokuren  love in the hell  further presents a quality ecchi satire that ended too soon and i reviewed both i wonder why sex focused american comics as images sex criminals can both get serious awards and stay on my pull list for the whole run while the japanese counterparts are regularly bottom of the barrel at least me and the devil blues came back but the author has a history of burning out as seen here so i will be cautious when i see his name pop up in the future as this isnt his first derailed porno
the reproduction memorabilia is terrific well written fun book a must for u fans

the genius of opposites  book nails it as an introvert i am energized by my extroverted clients and teammates but they also exhaust me the genius of opposites provides insights into the dynamics of our partnerships it provides immensely practical tools that i am already putting in place for how to make my work with opposites really work the walking meeting and taking breaks has already made a difference in tightening our communication thank you
great insight also the book was in great condition and was even autographed by rob merritt
excellent book about the mighty moves of god  we can learn much about their lives and the descriptions of the revivals
a must read  know the covenant of gods protection with his people
this is an outstanding indepth treatment of the subject for those able and willing to go the distance it will prove quite helpful i do wish there were a scaledback version that is more accessible to the average reader as the insights here are vital for a solid theological  anthropology
it was short but it was good braga rocks
very interesting and thought provoking
no wonder jules vernes works are classics i love the contents of this book it really brings me with the protagonists on their extraordinary voyages however i dont know why i sometimes find typos in this book like sometimes i see the spelled as he
my grandson loved this book
my grandson loved it and it counted in reading assignment so it was a winwin
this became one of my grandsons favorite books
decent i like how the autistic brother is portrayed it really shows just how challenging it can be to raise an autistic child the romance was extremely cute the average college kid and the portrayal of his lifestyle i think is very accurate and relatable
excellent read
another awesome book by sutton  it is a must read trilogy  fdr bolshevism and hitler and wall street  id add the federal reserve conspiracy too  he also wrote a book exposing the bushs  the world is not what it seems and this book will start opening your eyes  the only issue is that taking this book alone  you dont get the strong connection of wall street to the bank of england which runs it and you
sutton is an awesome researcher  here is the book that clearly answers the question was fdr a communist  the answer is a little more complex than the question but i dont think anyone will walk away disappointed or unable to give a firm reply with lots of supporting facts that question if you pursue it or have pursued it  will change your life
this is a very well written sequence of stories  the author really knows the area trails and mountains  if you have been in the whites it is fun just to read about the trails and the history  of course the loss of life is tragic  if youre like me it helps to reground you so that you enjoy the wilderness more and appreciate the times that the lord didnt punish your arrogance  maybe it will help prevent becoming a statistic
all tractor parts fit as was stated
practically new and delivered on time
i love science fiction and this book didnt disappoint i do a lot of reading and this is just as good as many novels ive read the story flows well and keeps you interested i am anxious to get started on the book that follows there are a few typos but a very good read for a first book
great readbr br great read
i return to this text every semester
if youre interested in islam and can read arabic taha huseeins work is your best pick unlike most muslim authors who write about islam he is unbiased and can be critical he searched the subject well and presented diverse historical views and concluded appropriately
great book i think it is most helpful in teaching parents how to read to their kids at night time emphasize the sleepy parts yawn and make your own voice sound tired etc it is  pages and has a ton of words generally one picture per  pages  great for a slightly older toddler that is already tired and will sit on your lap my  mo old was sleepy but got bored after the first page and  i think it will eventually work for him
wow this is a book that can change your life its a page turner for certain not only does it speak to the heart but also gives specific guidelines for shaping ones journey in a way that is healthy and gentle its a book that presents a personal challenge in a way that resonates on a profound level i have officially given self and accepted from self my ultimatum for wellbeing thank you dr susie carmack for your truth and for honoring me with a prepublishing sneak peekbr br love and lightbr br julie blamphinbr writer poet founder of stretch your spirit yoga and meditationbr wwwstretchyourspiritcom

encouraging and specific
the writer is very descriptive
its a lot to swallow but ill go out on a limb and say i believe what he has written  its either true or its not and there just seems to be too much information out there for it to be a total work of fiction  even though its pretty wild stuff  but i do recommend it to anyone with even a slightly open mind  the world is a mess and something has got to change  lets hope this book takes us one step closer to saving ourselvesbr ps   i saw something once that i cant explain  i thought it was a ufo
excellent read from the very first page to the last page
once again bella forrest has created another addictive book that is hard to put down and leaves the reader impatiently wanting more and needing to find out what happens next i can not wait for the next instalment it is impossible to anticipate which way the story will go which makes it exhilarating there are many surprises along the way the relationships beginning to form between some of the main characters are very interesting the chemistry between some of them is electric and new relationships are blossoming i love how the story is told through their different perspectives it keeps it exciting and gives a great insight into each characters internal dialogue i recommend this series to everyone because it is captivating and once you start reading it it is impossible to stop try book one i promise you wont regret it thank you bella for another amazing book roll on the next one 
i loved this book  it keep me turning pages long past my usual lights out  the characters become so real that i felt like i knew them but kept me wondering what they were going to do next  although this is well suited for young adult readers it translates really well to adult scifi  the action is great and the technology is creative and challenging  a really great read and i cant wait for book 
good info but way too short for the money
loved all three boos
excellent
exactly what i wanted
she learned things about her body she didnt know
this is a must read for anyone that has every felt like they have every reason to give up just when you think that your having the hardest day or year of your life you will realize that there really are people out there that are going through much worse situations than you are yet they dig deep they persevere and they win  they not only win  but they open their hearts as wide as humanly possible and they teach anyone that has a desire to succeed just how to do it they have proven to everyone that it really is never too late brian luzier

an ok book for collectors
felt this was a more balanced view of moses and his projects  not as detailed in looking at moses life but much more detailed when discussing the projects  like him or hate him you must tip your cap to the projects he build and the creativity to get them built
the actual story of building a great city like new york was worth reading  however the book seemed more like a hitpiece on mr moses than an objective book  the book doesnt take into consideration the context of the time in which mr moses worked the breadth of time and the span of projects that robert moses accomplished is astounding especially when you consider many are still functional today  i was more interested in how he used the funding system to accomplish new york citys goals i read the book to see how he managed to fund and build his projects i got more of a lecture on how bad he was i get that it is fashionable to dislike moses and his methods but we sure could use even half of his know how to rebuild our infrastructure and manage funding of projectsbr br i would have preferred a more objective look at moses and the context of the world he operated
very satisfied
fun read for preteens
my granddaughter loves this series
my granddaughter didnt want this book to end
a classic made a great gift
first i went to see the movie and maybe thats why i found this book has a lack of concise story first i want to give this book  stars but since i start to read his second alex cross novel kiss the girls i found that james patteson is one of the greatest mystery novelist the plot is good and reasonable it has unexpected twists but in the middle of the book after kidnaping it seemed as patterson didnt know how to continue the idea he has started with so there is like  an plus pages you can easily skip but the ending is unexpected and really surprising its just somehow irritating as suspense novel is everything but taut in the place where you want to let your dog starve for a day and your finacee is waiting for a ball game just for you but you are in your own universe  the serial kidnaper is an intelegent person and so the hero needs to be so this is a good premise which run well in the novel as its his first novel you can see that character of alex cross isnt buildup very well yet so sometimes the hero reacts or behave in outoflogic manner and in some parts of the book hes not so belivable story is well buid there is enough of suspense and unusual twists still worth of your time and money just to introduce yourself to the st part of great mystery travel to crossland
living outside of states in europe i was primaly intrasted in describing young soul living in a big ny i was more then suprised to find out how an actor can express such amount of emotional descritpion of love you would  think that an author would be able to feel his protagonist of this book  but actually wraped it in words and to do it so accuratively was just a big  cheerful event of i would like to read more ethan hawk greatly with  passion of an elder experince writter has described this young character  and his struggle in this world after seeing great expectations i can  understand where he gets his inspiration from i think that you acctually  can notice a lack of not being used to wriitng but promisses a great author  soon looking forward for next one
live by night hits a lot of issues in the area of its plot i didnt like in the given day but thankfully dennis lehane is a writer that even when hes pushing a somewhat cliched rags to riches back to rags gangster story he buoys his story with likeable characters descriptions that bring to detail the atmosphere hes pushing and an interesting historical background to add to the main plottheres not much in live by night that wont remind you of scarface or the plot of the videogame mafia  if youre an avid follower of such material the plot concerns joe coughlin a rather minor character from lehanes the given day who was a small boy in the previous novel has become a low rung gangster henchman after his boss is killed by a rival gangster through a series of unfortunate tragedies involving the rival gangsters mistress and friends accompliced in a bank robbery hes sent to prison where he befriends italian mobster maso pescatore after saving him from a rival gangs hit in payment pescatore sendshim to florida to take over the mafias rum running operation he rises in power mediating disputes with locals and helping smuggle weapons to cuban revolutionariesthe cuban revolutionary point is an interesting point to put into the story one of those lehane momnets that add more to the story but in all honesty for its strengths and few issues its the characters who drive the story and theres some humanizing in joefromn the way he handles a moonshining red neck to the killing of klansman he tries to dissuade from disrupting business hes a really likeable hood that doesnt fall into the trap of being to ridiculously macho as these characters can tend to be as the book opens up on his downfall you do feel somewhat sorry as he continues on a path to his troubles all of the ancillary characters are thankfully quiet and restrained compared to some of lehanes novels albert white isnt some grinning evil but a villain who never lets his temper show making his violence and evil seem all the more cruel maso is the kindly grandfather type who just wants business to run the way he wants it to and graciela while stretching somewhat into the overly heroic love interest is good for the strong willed typelehanes prose has a quality to it i wont lie he finds the write voice for the story neither being long and flowery but still taking its time with the story theres a horrific quality when two men are hung from a building but an equal ammount of beauty tojoe playing baseball with a group of children in cuba after he builds a diamond one of my problems with the given day was the overabundance of characters sure he wrote the story with an epic flair but the dearth of characters pulled the story in too many directions im more for the events of live by night that give the novel its feel of the epic but keeps the plot focused on joelehane is a sharp writer and with this novel hes improved setting a plot more for period live by night is another great read fromn an excellent crime fiction writer that will stand with his best
this is regarding the no limit part of the book considering hellmuth is perhaps the greatest no limit player of all time his discussion of no limit is lackluster at best in fact it is all but worthless but to the most inexperienced player someone who has never played even for the inexperiencedhowever there are much better books on the topic i highly suggest buying super systems  whether you are a beginner or an experienced player super system  is well worth the money play poker like the pros is hardly worth the paper upon which it was printed
because reading is so completely subjective so much of what i love others hatei checked the average rating for this book before starting it  and i wish i hadnt i inadvertently read a huge spoiler and wondered if the story was ruined for meit wasnti felt the story stayed true to the first two books in the series it was a good although sad conclusion we got all of our answers and resolutionwas the good people are really bad people story line a bit tired yes it was to me but that doesnt make the book or series bad in any way it kept my interest kept me emotionally invested and entertained me those are three very important qualities that i need in a bookdo recommend
picked this up at a whim a couple of weeks ago  really i knew mr barker wrote horror and knew his name from video games sporting his title but thats about the extent of the background ive had with himhave to say the beginning  middle of the book were excellent  the initial shock of thinking family abuse happens in hell really kind of turned my thinking around about how hell works  you think of demons being powerful
this book is awful  rose is completely selfish and self absorbed she does whatever she wants with no regard to anyones feelings and ends up running away from all her problems other than an unlikeable main character there really is no plot and the ending is flat save your money and time
what can i say that hasnt already been said in these reviews a nice read  haldeman weaves the thought of warfare without care or understanding to the idea of long periods of time when the soldiers are traveling that soon become hundreds of years making a classic novel
cryptonomicon is a interesting book it deals with code breakers during world war ii then jumps all the way to the s the book had interesting moments but parts of it were dry and dull and felt like you were being lectured how math if i wanted that id pick up a math textbook plus theres plenty of tom clancyesque technobabble if you are into straight up world war ii military fiction this book will feel weird and confusing if you are not a techie person you will absolutely hate this book this maybe the ultimate geek novel of all time its also a long book so you will have to take your timethe main plot of the first half of the book is set during the war and involves code breaking lawrence pritchard waterhouse has to hid the fact that the us has just cracked important german codes and now they have to plus theres also a plot by the japanese to build a mysterious building
i thought this book was an excellent introduction to a wide range of difficult  concepts  the author makes complicated ideas easy to understand i strongly recommend the book to people interested in both  einsteins life and the amazing theories that grew from his  work  people who like this book would also like cliff pickovers book quottime  a travelers guidequot
what i liked about this series the way the cases always have such neat and clever endings with the possible exception of the flaming footprints the very original and inventive plots the occasional twists the person you thought was bad suddenly turns good the ghosttoghost hook up  i think thats really cleverwhat i didnt like about this series i find it very annoying that the  main characters are boys  all right i know that it was written in the sixties but being a next generation female this is the greatest problem i cant think of any girl that is involved in any of their cases the club house  kind of cliched dont you think  also the secret passageways into the junkyard  how did those come about  how did they fix up the printer and the darkroom and all that  none of them seem to show any kind of electrical prowess the way the boys always have everything they need at their disposal through the junkyard thecompetition in which jupiter won the rolls etc etc why is bob always stuck in records and research its infuriating the way he never does anything exciting jupiters pompous and knowitall manner  how can his friends stand it  how can he have friends skinny norris is another stereotype  the bully who gets in the heros wayas you can see theres a lot more bad than good but seriously i do like these books  theyre so original and imaginitivei do think that kids these days arent really going to get into these books  theyre too old fashioned  hey i only read them because i have the weirdest and most varied taste in books ive ever come across
in my opinion this book started out really slow in fact i put this book aside after reading around forty pages and then picked it up again a few weeks later determined to finishwhen i did pick it up again though i was quickly intrigued and i finished it in less than a day still in my opinion it was only worthy of four stars it seemed kind of farfetched and even though that is part of what i respect about meg cabot i thought that it could have been better
when i first saw this book i looked inside and i was like whoa emails and letters this is gonna get confusing but once i started reading it i couldnt put it down i try to put some variety into my reading because its boring reading the same old thing every day and this did it i havent read a book this funny since i read sloppy firsts and second helpings by megan mccafferty i could not stop laughing and now my best friend is begging me to let her read itsoooooooo enjoyable it started off kind of dull but towards the middle it really picked up and i couldnt put it down just having to know what happens nextrecommended to anyone who wants a good laugh and to read a good book
after a day of hiding the title of this book at school i finished and i just have to say the boy books by meg cabot are entirely hilarious
after reading this book i dont think i will ever think of books the same way again i am a reader of all books whether its ya or romance or mysterybut this book was a historical romance and i am so not used to it however being my first historical romance i thought it was wonderful at least the first threefourths were towards the end it became slightly random and pointless but at the end it wrapped it up nicely and i realized why lisa kleypas put in so many of those seemingly unneccessary pointsoverall i was very happy and ill be sure to check out the next book in the wallflower series 
i was sort of expecting alot from this book and it didnt exactly do for me what i wanted it was sort of fastpaced and didnt really go into much description we got the background information about what was going on in the story but we never really got to know raven except for her fascination with vampiresalthough this book was like a roller coaster at times it was good and at times i didnt care much for it i have to give it  stars because i loved the way it ended and it left so much open for a sequal i still have hope for this series but i just have to say that this book wasnt nearly as good as twilight or new moon by stephenie meyer
mia is trying to find a way to get michael to take her to the prom in this book shes also having problems because grandmere took her dog rommel to mias birthday dinner and when he escapes he causes a waiter to spill soup on grandmere and get the waiter fired which is unjust and it causes a whole strike in the cityeither way i enjoyed it and this book had a happy ending
meg cabot did not disappoint me with this book ive read boy meets girl and while i think this one was not as good it was still goodfunny sarcastic and suspenseful if a chicklit could be suspenseful and really sweet if you love meg cabot you will love this
once again sharon creech tells her story in the shape of a journal in fact there are even two different points of view codys and sophies you know instantly theres something strange going on which makes you want to read until the very end to find out what it is also very funny and i would definitely recommend this book to any sharon creech fan
this is probably my favorite gail carson levine book next to ella enchanted princess addie goes on a quest to save her sister and along the way she falls in love with the sorcerer rhys battles dragons and finds inner strength the end is very surprising but not in a bad wayrecommended for lovers of fairy tales
the reason i like meg cabot is because she makes almost impossible things seem real first i read teen idol and it actually made me believe that an actor could come to any ordinary school and this where the girl saves the president is very farfetched but i loved it because it was so funny and it was so real it made going out with the first son seem like something any girl can do recommended for a good laugh
scott westerfeld has a pretty interesting mind coming up with unique books i adore the uglies series and i like the first book of this trilogy too its really interesting to see a time that nobody else knows of even if its completely fictional it seems like this book has all the elements of a good ya novel but to me it was lacking maybe i had high expectations because of how much i loved uglies either way im not in too big of a hurry to read the second one maybe if i can get ahold of it easily i will but im not going to go out of my way to read it
for a sexy mystery as i like to call them
this was such a fun book to read since it is fastpaced and always leaves me wondering what was going to come up next it has just the right mixture of all the perfect teen elements romance family travel and a likeable narrator while it was hard to understand at times because maureen johnson seems to jump from place to place pretty quickly and the narrators thoughts arent really made clear i still enjoyed this book very much and i think that any other teenager will like it too
i honestly thought this was better than secrets of a summer night although i prefer the other characters better this seemed more concluded and yet very very openstill it was sweet and fluffy and kept me going until the end and now i need to read book number 
so what happens when evie and lord st vincent get married not for love either but convenienceit blossoms into something much more obviously lisa kleypas did not disappoint when she wrote this it was so true to her wallflower series and the style that i couldnt put it down it took me less than a day to finish and i think if you loved the first two or even just the first one since the second one wasnt nearly as good than you will worship this book the best in the series so far lets just hope that scandal in spring is just as good although i hope it is
i must admit all four of these books are predictable and very similar in plot but that doesnt stop me from loving them and loving the characters books like these are exactly what i need when my life seems hopeless because now that there is hope for matthew and daisy it seems like theres hope for mei am sad to see this series go but dont expect this to be the last i read of lisa kleypas
this book was okay very short easy to read it covers what mia is doing on her spring break and how she has a hard time adapting to the wilderness because she is a city girlbut i think shes gotta get used to it if she wants to save the whales or whateverbut its only fifty pages and you should read it because after all you gotta take the good with the bad and if you loved her other novels you should try to keep up
bound to be a favourite with all small children its easy to read and has an engrossing story with a great endinghighly recommend itolder children and adults may enjoymisadventures of a zoo keeper
i thought it was rather poorly written but did have a good plot  this is the first book i have read by this author and it is not one of my favorites
this is the book you give your students so they can see how not to write  but laughably so if they have a sense of humor truly a bombastic gem
i have always loved anything written by lawrence block  somehow or another i got away without reading this one before  lucky for me  good from start to finish
odd thomas is far and away my favorite character excellent story line  with great new characters if you havent read all the odd stories read them now
brilliantly written but a masterpiece of partisanism if gw bush one day will take this guy to court he will have to leave behind even his underwears the allegations he made are absolute rubbish from beginning to the endif george w was the quotthief in chiefquot then al gore would have to be the stupid in chief if you go to a department store and they cheat on your bill what will you do having the right on your side you will fight to the end to have your money back but what about al gore he has been cheated according to the author of the the top job in the world and he just kept quiet about that so if this is real he would have never been worth of the top job itself
here is my advice  if you love the hbo series on television then buy the books and read them  or if you like stuff like king arthur merlin medieval times tolkein then you will enjoy  just an epic adventurewith the sex and violence comes the caution that these books are not for kids  i think i would say  on the books if your children are asking for themonly critique is that there are so many characters added and so many places in the realm i sometimes find myself referring back to another book or to the maps which can be kind of fun too  i also missed some of the characters that he killed off or those that didnt make the cut to this book  cant wait for the next one  brilliant author
i found the book to be drawn out  did not enjoy reading it as much as the first book  the book looses its intrigue  will not be buying the other two books that follow on dance of dragons  will rather watch the tv series game of thrones
enjoyable reading with great ideas positive message that if you really want to publish you can do it
i have read many true storiesbut this is one of best everthe other was  the long walk both should be  stars
it gives a fighting chance at a diet to control diabetes for those open to triumphing over this terrible disease
brought back so many wonderful memories of my aunt reading me this story i look forward to sharing this experience with my granddaughter
i cant believe it took me this long to get around to this book  it is honestly the best book i ever read
big book but an easy and quick readthis book does lack lots of details of their escapades  they really just state the escapade and move on  i am not sure if this stuff really happened or were they just too smashed to remember what happenedi did not feel like i was there like other readers express but i still admire the crues reflections on their upbringing and how they feel about themselves  any reader can tell that due to their childhood that they lack alot of maturity or ability to handle all their fame and people they meetnonetheless this book is great and i enjoy picking up the book and reading about their adventures with the drugs and the girls
psnot the ending i would have chosenbut all in all okay  really enjoyed each bookthanks  and make some more stories
love love love veronica roth  what a talented author  and i cant wait for the movie  i really enjoyed this third book and like the first two read it very quickly not wanting to put it down  yes the ending was extremely shocking and sad  in fact i went back and reread that part twice to make sure what i thought had happened actually did  no maybe it wasnt how i wished it ended but it did not take away from the fact that i still feel the story was well written and dramatic and enjoyable
as an avid reader of presidential history i was eagerly awaiting this new book by mr brinkley particulary after viewing his qa programs on cspan  the book was very long and took me an exceedingly long time to read unless you have an interest in both forest wildlife birds and their preservation this book wouldnt be for you  in addition this book has many more typos and grammar errors than almost any book i have ever read before  did harper collins lay off all persons who editproofread their books and could they not afford spellcheckwould recommend edmund morriss first tr volume instead of this it covers this same territory and a whole lot more
great book the writing is so fluid it paints a realistic pictuer in your head some of the things you see coming and some you do not but dennis lehane still manages to surprise you
as me before you  i thought it was disappointing after loving me before you so much i decided i wanted to read another of her books but was sadly disappointed by this one too much like a romance novel not nearly as wellwritten or as smart or as interestingit starts off well but then just falls slowly and decidedly into that romance novellike formula that is just tiresome and boring  the end is so unoriginal  completely predictable  yawni expected better than this from this author
once youve read all of the alist wharton novels several times over
contains spoilersthe beginning of this book bored me nearly to tears i had to continue because its a trilogy and you have to see it through at this point if it were the first book i wouldnt have completed it to the endafter i read about  i felt tris was acting without thinking things through she chose a side by her emotions wanting to fight those that were responsible for her parents death and not by considering whether it was the right side a person shouldnt fight or start a revolution out of revengeim not bummed tris died its a story and i accept death even imaginary characters what im bummed about is that there was a meeting between evelyn and marcus and theres suddenly peace in chicago two armies at odds wont easily put down their weapons especially those trained as dauntlessthe ending after tris died felt rushed hurry up and show the world is better because of tris death i guess it was written that way because this was tris story and thus dead the story should end but veronica had to continue to give her death meaningi was a four fan but i am not any more uriah died because of his actions period there was no way to blame nita she couldnt have done what she did without his actions
if ever a technical book deserved a gadzillion stars this one did it really does deliver what it promisesin his introduction paul mcfedries says that he will quotteach you how to create beautiful web pages in no time flat its my goal in this book to show you that its really quite simple and that anyone can build a page with their bare handsquot he succeeds admirably the book set up is simple and easy to follow and as mcfedries promises you can follow through the steps just as they are organized in the book and in no time start shaping together your own web pagesthe complete idiots guide to creating a web page doesnt assume you have any previous knowledge with web page production good job too and this means that you really do start from scratch slowly building your htlm knowledge all information is presented in short easytodigest chunks and the referencing is clear an preciseas a bonus the accompanying cd has notes and examples on all the chapters and completes the perfect manual for beginners on the web well done paul mcfedries
im somehow uneasy about passion for truth theres no denying that its a wellwritten version of events but its clear to me a nonamerican living in europe that the senator tells it how he sees it not maybe how it was i cant identify exactly why i hold this view but something tells me that the author is not being wholly honest with himself maybe he set out to be honest and maybe he believes that he has been honest but i just have nagging doubts its possibly got something to do with his overinflated opinion of himself  a trait spotted by other reviewersa while ago i read and reviewed john majors autobiography whatever you may have thought about major as a prime minister his autobiography was refreshingly honest and that sincerity shone through im afraid i cannot say the same about senator specter i had the feeling that he was trying to justify his decisions and actionsall that said passion for truth was an intriguing read  particularly sen specters support for the single bullet theory  a theory as flawed as a cracked diamond but theres no doubting sen specters passion for sticking to his guns be he right or be he wrong clearly he has been a highly successful politician so maybe his overt narcissism is wellearned anybody whether you agree with them or not who has had a career as high profile as specters is worthy of a retrospective autobiography and passion for truth delivers what it says  one mans view on his own life
i appreciate getting the book at the great price  im really not complaining but the book was quite yellow and the jacket was torn in various places  it looked like it was on the shelf for quite a whilemaureen
i love terry pratchetts writing and cant pick just one favorite but this is definitely one of them night watch is a bit more serious than some of his other books though there is certainly humor in it it gives some background on a few main characters and ankhmorpork itself
i always enjoy her books as they appeal to my sense of humour  it is always a pleasure to read her books and i am looking forward to reading her latest book
let me start by saying i tend to like the oprah picks its a great way to read books that im not familiar with or normaly wouldnt read  however i really had to force my way through this one  i found the story compelling and loved how its told through each womans voice  kingsolver is so descript in her vision of the congo you almost feel the symptoms of malaria  that said this is not a feel good read bright spots are few and far betweeen  i kept thinking quotwhen are they going to catch a breakquot to no avail  and there are some lulls that seem to exist to make this an quotepicquot  i would give it   stars based on the voice of adahhow about a sequel just based on her life
charlie papazian is the godfather of homebrewing  he founded the american homebrewers association and organized the great american beer festival  he is a master brewer capable of creating authoritative detailed charts and tables techniques and equipment information for the advanced brewer  actually he does but not in this book  this book is for those who are new to brewing and who may be intimidated by the complexity of the brewing process  charlie takes you by the hand pats you on the back and reminds you to relax
it was for my sons summer reading program at school he has been reading it at summer camp and enjoying it
i am a huge marian keys fan and i have to say this book did not disappoint  keep in mind this is not great literaturethis is definitely chick lit  although i knew who lucy was going to end up with by page  i still thoroughly enjoyed this book it was interesting to see how she finally got her man in the end  highly entertaining very funny and a great beach read
as human beings and americans living in the st century we are taught to be constantly striving for something better a better job a better body a better mate a better life etc etc etc this book challenges that way of thinking and encourages us to see this moment in the life we have right now as the best possible teacher instead of always running toward something better
i am so addicted  i cannot wait for season  to start and for book  to be released  and i need this to be the end i have already read  pages
i loved reading this book when i was young and horse crazy and gave it to my horse crazed grand daughter as a gift to read
he is a good and easy story teller and it opened my mind to my wwii father and asked him if he had traveled through that town but his train didnt go that way
ahhhhhh what a disappointing end to an otherwise awesome series i feel like the only emotion the author got right here was grief and by that point it was too late too much was spelled out not enough leg  to the imagination and just overall disappointing compared to the other  sorry ms roth i enjoyed the series but hated this novel
coming back and writing this review having read this awhile ago i am reminded of how much i loved reading this and how to this day i still recommend this book to others  even if being a pick up artist isnt your thing wasnt mine the story itself and the colorful characters make the read worth it
i liked the story line  it held your interest   i did figure out the villain before he said but my reasoning was different for the book  all in all it was a really good read
the characters in this book are amazing people women  of strength and compassion that survive in spite of an evangelical psychotic father husband life in the congo starts out from such a narrow and naveteacute point of view on christianity and has to change drastically in order to survive but becomes a more realistic view for the women its a story of how such narrow mindedness can destroy and in this case it does excellent read and good food for thought for all
good book nearly finsihed reading it would recommend if your interested in cults and the abuse the did to children
i was disappointed with this book because i happen to like this author a lot and i go through each of her books within a day and yet this one just dragged lady catherine just irritated me she was such a shrew andrew seemed to be too good for her in alessandros previous book who will take this man
warning spoilersi really didnt like the choice to have the story told from two different perspectives tris and tobias especially in the beginning when they were both doing the same thing anyway but it definitely gave me an ominous feeling that it might be necessary laterone of my friends told me that she hated the ending so then i was thinking that both tris and tobias died or they accidentally erased the whole citys memories or something else crazy like that as it turned out it was just tris of course for the first  pages after she died i didnt believe she could really be deadbut i didnt hate the ending i thought it was well wrapped up and justified her death there was a really good conclusion that seemed realistic and made me care that tris died without thinking she died for nothingthe rest of the book though was just ok i liked learning about the compound and the backstory for chicagos current state the plot itself was pretty good except for the constant need to stop for tris and tobias to fight or make out or mope around about the state of their relationshipso this is a hard book to rate ill go  stars  for the yaness of it all total of 
this was a great book i read it in no time  it is an exciting tle of two sisters and a fearsome journey  wonderful story it is well written
having the first three books in the tales of the city series all in one place is a huge convenience as i am continually reading them  there is an absurd joy i get whenever i read these stories  please understand
what armistead maupin spent three books building up he spends three books knocking down i was made to care so much for these characters that reading the final three books in the series is like listening to someone bad mouth your family everything that i loved about the first three books the absurdity the strange innocence the surrogate family the characters have created for themselves is gone in all honesty my main problem is that the story and the characters simply dont do what i want them to do the characters simply dont seem to like each other anymore i realize maupin was in a very different place in his life when he wrote the final books but i just didnt enjoy reading them its remarkably childish but in my mind the series ends with book threethe first three novels get five stars from me straight across the board the final three novels with this collection get about a three babycakes is pretty good
in american gods neil gaimen did something i have been thinking about doing
i usuallt dread the bedtime routine because im so tired at the end of the day ever since i discovered shel silverstein and particularly this book its been so much fun reading with my daughter shes in st grade she can read it herdelf for the most part her comprehension is good in general but i think reading poems and funny and silly poems like these help a lot with comprehension its been a bonding experience instead of the uick night time reading since i bought this book highly recommend it
i have always held the author neil gaiman in high esteem he remains one of the few writers who can magically change reality into fantasy and fantasy back into reality while the reader sits in a spellbound position i have read most of his books and would advise an avid reader to follow my lead and do the same see my other book reviewsi was not only shocked by this the antithesis of his other works but the number of readers who felt this is one of their top  books they have ever read maybe the latter shows how unskilled the public has become at adept reader analysis and furthermore that they should refrain from other comments outside of evaluating marvel comics and the color of supermans capeneil gaimon in this writing incident did one of a variety of things he may have hired an editor who was driven by his need to have the writers approval rather than aiding in making the story a more readable text for the consumer or the author may have simply found himself caught up in all the previous accolades of earlier writings that he forgot what got him there or the author may have simply gotten lazy his characters are flat and are mere shadow figures rather than identifiable beings his story is muddled giving the appearance that he was making it up as he went along and his plot line was never well defined are these characters dead still alive or in between are these characters gods or humans which ones of these numerous gods are we supposed to affix in our memory banks that will be brought back before the conclusion occurs we are never sure of any of these answers even after we have turned the last pagethe author did however preform the the much desired whodunit trick at the end he drew together previous characters into a surprising ending he did so however without ever clearly defining them in the first place so when we reach the conclusion we are required to go back to earlier chapters to recollect who these characters are neil because i have applauded neverworld the graveyard book and stardust i feel that i have the equal right to issue my displeasure over your explosion in a word factory which you called american gods
although the author at times writes in a choppy manner and his text is flooded with names that the reading public have little awareness this is a must read for those who want to understand the influence that elite fundamentalism has on us politics and world affairs from detailed research and firsthand interaction with the family
this is one of the best books ive read on this subject the author has spent a lot of effort in researching the history culture geography and social groups present at the time of christ through to the production of the new testament he starts out grounding the reader in what details we know surrounding the geographic area and political events around the time of christs ministry he then progresses onto the actual writings we have today starting with the earliest written the pauline letters and moving on chronologically through the gospels and the remainder of what we have as the new testament and finally the apocryphal writings that are not part of our standard current day new testamentthe book at times especially early on and also toward the end bogs down a little in history but once the author moves onto the actual writings and events surrounding them the pace picks upthe book is divided into  partspart one the world of the new testamentpart two the first generation  sectarian beginningspart three the second generation  birth pangs and new horizonspart four the third generation  from sect to churchpart five the fourth generation  coming of age in the roman worldthis book reads somewhat like a textbook and as such contains extensive data on this topic the author will mention more than one theory on sources of the material and then proceed based on the most accepted otherwise he assumes nothing but presents an unbiased account of what most likely happenedthis book is an eye opener on how we got the bible particularly the new testament in the format we have today other than the times it gets lost in historical detail my only other criticism is that the book tends to end abruptly i would have like to have read more on the nicene creed and the process of collating the canon we have today rather than seeing this in a few rushed final paragraphs
this was bought for my grandchildren and it delivers on every aspect from well written and illustrated to something they will treasure for a lifetime  you will not be disappointed if you buy this book only drawback it is large for them to hold by themselves but that is the beauty of the bookyou get to sit and read to your grandchildren
anyone who loves little critter will love this book he is starting to get into trouble and ends up saving the day a nice way to introduce little kids to dinosaurs
authoritative  nurturing  friendly  enlightening  the whole is greater than the sum of the parts  bravo
i am as obsessed with george r r martins as i was with steven king back in the s and s i am so absorbed with all his books i go back and read passages in his other books in the series  of all his characters i like the dragons best  no i really love them  so i currently am downloading all of martins books  dragons was a five all the way
ms millers historical overview is excellent  our interpretation of what exists in the afterlife has greatly changed in the past  years  it has grown and matured as mankind has grown more complex  ms miller makes this journey fascinating  she also debunks many of our current myths about other religions views of heaven eg the  virgins of islam  yes as this book is written by an american for the american audience she does for the most part deal with the three major religions in america  this may be offputting to some  one warning  you must approach this book with an open mind  when i was reading it one deeply religious baptist friend asked me what i was reading and i explained that it was a book that described how our views on heaven have changed over the past  years  she gave me a blank expression and informed me that heaven has never changed  i had to quickly say
often in books on wwii a central character will rise above the odds and with one heroic sweep of the hand slay the enemy and carry the day  throw that nonsense out the window with quotthe forgotten soldierquot this  book brought home the reality of war unlike any book i have ever read it  was completely read by myself in  days at work before work and wherever  possible when describing the brutal reality of the eastern front is  somewhat like passing by a fatal accident you know you shouldnt slow down  to gawk but you do anyway  this book will make anyone fear war if you  read about wwii and have not read this book then your circle is  definitely incomplete
this is a well written book that gives some great insight into the people working in the field as well as some basic understanding of genetics
this is a fun book to read i bought it to try to teach my daughter where to go to the potty hopefully ill have more luck with my son
a fine satisfactory read  lehane knows his characters and their environs and when i read his writing i feel that i know also
what a wonderful novel  using a woman who turns herself surreptiously into a roman catholic priest manning an indian mission in the middle of the th century gives erdrich a voice with which to speak volumes in every direction  excellent
im glad i got this book for free  id hate to think i wasted money on itthe writer spends and exorbitant amount of time describing the characters feelings and thoughts to the point that it is boring to the extreme  i didnt even make it to the end of the first section before deciding that life was too short to keep trying to read this book  maybe if the author had chamberlain and churchill go after each other with broadswords and dueling pistols in the london underground it would have at least have had a little action and been more interesting
i give veronica roth credit for coming up with a different spin on the possible future of society  i thought the whole concept was rather interesting  the divergent series is good and i do look forward to the upcoming movie  tris and fours relationship touches youhowever id have to say allegiant was my least favorite of the three  im not going to be more specific than that because i do not want to include any spoilers  however perhaps how it ends was rather daring in the big picture sort of waysodo give the divergent series a try and see what you think of how it ends
i read this book through and even found myself googling the historic figures i spent a whole session looking at hans holbein the youngers portraits of many of the key players in this engrossing novelunfortunately there was one distracting conceit that made the book more of a wadethrough than it could have been cromwell is always referred to in the second person even when several men are in the scene and are conversing mantel resorts to parentheses to clarify who is talking why not be out with it cromwell said more said norfolk said it is noninvasive and timehonoredanother problem with this lengthy novel is the overabundance of players frequently writers choose to combine minor characters particularly when their distinction does nothing to move the story along while it is impressive that mantel could keep track of all of the endless tom dick and harrys in this intricately plotted work i as the reader could not and now that the book is finished i regret the many times i consulted the books cast of characters these distinctions did nothing to enrich cromwells character nor did they amount to anything in terms of entertaining subplots as i was reading i cared far too much who was whoin the end it was unnecessary and did not prove to enrich my understanding of the main figures motives or their fateand lastly i was left curious about the decision as to how much of the events to include  why make a story focus on cromwell yet begin and end with the fate of other historic figures why not include ann boleyns fate in fact why not cover cromwells downfall the conclusion of this book made for a letdown and puzzlement as to the authors sense of what makes for a good storythe book was interesting to read and fascinating in its historic detail and clarification of the complicated forces in play during englands break from the pope and the events leading up to henry viiis establishment as head of the church in england mantel is undeniably a gifted writer unfortunately the work as a whole is less than compelling
i am interested in wwii stories but this one was kind of tedious in my opinion  this is a true story but seemed a little long with lots of side stories about the individuals involved
in the earth path starhawk discusses the elements of earth air fire and water and ways that we can connect with each in order to work towards healing the environmental damage weve done to the earth in the past  the book is mainly concerned with returning to amore natural state of living ie growing own foodthis is a very starhawk book  there is a lot of good advice as well as inpiring and emotive writing
this is a fabulous cookbook  i dont cook much anymore but i like the fact that this cookbook is superb in directions for using certain food items that are unknown to me buying preparing storing it is like having an aunt or grandmother standing by  this is about the th one i have bought as i love to give them as shower gifts
this is really a mans book but i loved it anyway and bought one for someone elsethe research was meticulously done and the story was incredible a mixture of sorrow and joy intrigue and fear the crash survivors were amazing in how they handles their problems and i liked their interaction with the new guinea natives who found them so fascinatingthey were lucky the natives werent really head huntersthey only ate their enemies
my daughter and i read this book together about every  months i believe it teacher how she should be treated by male or female and it also keeps me in check as well i have learned many things from it as well and it also helps us to set healthy boundaries with others our girls are out there and we cant see everything that they see and do but if we can protect them by educating them of what a good relationship then we wont have to worry about them being mistreated my their boyfriends or peers
this is a terrific book  its fun to read and very comprehensive  this is excellent instruction for the beginning cook but has plenty of information for more experienced buyers also  so many of todays cookbooks are more specialized than the average cook wants  or they will use ingredients unavailable in regular markets  this book will demonstrate how to make delicious dishes using readilyavailable ingredients able to be created by the lessexperienced cookalong with cunninghams fannie farmer books this should be a keystone to a cooks collection
read other reviews for a detailed description of the book  having been raised on the king james bible i knew basically nothing of the story behind it  this story has been marvelously brought to life by the author  it certainly must not be any type of academic reference and im grateful for that  this book appears to written for those like me not schooled in theology or history from this period  i found it as entertaining as any novel and could possibly motivate readers to delve further into the period  highly recommended

another great story line by mr t g the first third and last third  was riveting fast paced and exciting what happened in the middle very repetitive in thought and sentencesfelt like you lost your way it was frustrating and heart breaking as i am a huge fan of every other book you have written still looking forward to the next part of the series please look at some of the reviewswe are trying to tell you somethingthis is what feedback is all about
this book gave me chills and stressed me out i was living through the eyes of these characters  i swear i felt every emotion every violation every threat of pain i stopped my breath when they did powerful writing
so funny so clever so much better than so many other books for kids  i loved the secret diary of adrian mole aged   when i read it as a kid  i love it even more now that im a grown woman and a reading teacher  its books like these that inspired me to love reading
while none of the characters in this pageturning tale of dysfunctional marriage are particularly likable they are nonetheless believable down to every last detail of their insecurities by the time i reached the final chapter i almost wanted to write to the author and ask her if ken kimble was patterned after my former best friends exhusband wouldnt surprise me like ken
this book obviously attracted a lot of attention  the sheer number of reviews   as of today is telltale  i am not a biochemist hence i had to rely on behes expertise in all those fascinating descriptions of the  enormous complexity of the biological systems  then on page  i  encountered behes calculation of probabilities this is much closer to my  expertise and i was appaled by the obvious lack of understanding of  probabilities by behe although similar meaningless calculations are rather  common in books of that genre behe managed quite convincingly show the  amazingly convoluted way the biological system do their jobs the more  examples given by behe i readthe more convincingly they seemed to prove  something opposite to his thesis about the necessity of assuming the  guiding hand of an intelligent designer whoever such could be i have  designed many devices for experiments in physics and electrochemistry and  so did my research students if any of them brought to me for approval a  design even  as complex as for example the system that clots blood i  would doubt hisher intelligence  since when the complexity has been a  sign of an intelligent solution all great inventions have been amazingly  simple  mr behe look for example at a sewing machine  a very complex  task of making a chain of loops through a piece of fabric is achieved by  using essentially only two but ingeniously designed parts  a needle of a  specific shape and a rotating hook  could it be done in a more convoluted  way you bet  the sewing machines patented before singer all were much  more complex and less reliable  two best machine guns uzi and ak are  also the simplest in design  if an engineer had to design an automatic  system which would stop leaks in a pipe would any minimally intelligent  designer do it in such an ineffective and unreliable way as by increasing  viscosity of the fluid and then restoring it back and using to that end  tens of parts of a very complex shape  that is how the bleeding is  stopped in biological system as per behes description or is indeed such  an immensely complex system as in a cilium necessary for a bacteria to  swim  it could be achieved by an incomparably simpler design the  complexity points toward either a very dumb designer or more probably to  a blind natural process of many unintentional trials and errors  i submit  also that the answer to that question has little to do with the question  of creators existence the natural process is equally possible in both  cases  whether or not such a creator of the world exist or the universe  exists on its own without a creator i do not know the answer to the last  question and i think such a question will never be answered  behes  arguments are though not convincing in the least
thanks seanthis is book is absolutely devastating to the socialistpacifist left  no wonder they hate it  keep up the great work
i started reading this book a few years back and never got around to finishing it i was intrigued by its different perspective on american history i got through about half the book and found myself bored with it i just couldnt get into it later i talked with a physician coworker of mine about this book i think he said it best when he said i really felt like it was a view of american history from a socialists perspective from that point on i really started thinking about that statement peoples republic of china
this book uses a slightly different format to tell the story  it reads like the script to a movie which is slightly daunting at first  its lots of type and in all sorts of different fonts but once you get into the storyline its hard to put it down  i read this one in an afternoon while sunbathing and ended up getting burnt because i didnt want to go inside  because of the unusual format ive had difficulty getting some of my students into this book  those that have gotten beyond the format truly enjoyed this novel
we found this book on a cart in the nicu while we were there after the birth of our daughter  it was one of our favorites and we read and reread it night after night  great memories
once again annie proulx has painted a masterpiece of individuals
these recipes were ok lots of spices and things that would be special purchases i really wanted to like it but it was just ok
this book as is the case with all of kleypas works is extremely well written entertaining and unpredictable  to the wallflowers
just finished the third kingdom exactly  hours after i received it i loved almost every minute of reading it i say almost because there were a couple of over repeated dialogue areas that i found erroneous and one particular scene that made me cry and broke my heart loved this particular scene even while i hated it im extremely glad that the richard  kahlan series is back and going strong overall this book is amazing and well worth the wait i would definitely recommend this book to anyone and cant wait for the next goodkind book
interracial unions are oftentimes sugar coated in the world of fiction  two people meet fall in love and never have any real problems  no one seems to notice their differences  not  in the real world these individuals will more than likely have to quotdealquot with the worldthats where similarities between this novel and others end  in meeting of the waters you have two reporters lenora black female and porter white male who meet and fall in love or not  you see they both have some reservations about starting up anything at some point or another  after lenora saves the life of porterliterally he is smittened  he cant stop thinking about her  hes somewhat at a loss because she temporarily disappears from his life  so as fate would have it lee lenora winds up moving to the same town in which he resides and working right alongside himlenora goes out of her way to resist porters advances because she would never date outside of her race  porter on the other hand doesnt see color or so he thinks  when lee finally gives in to him they begin an intense relationship  porter soon becomes frustrated with lees constant references to race  the subject of race has taken up every aspect of their lives something of which porter is not use to  hes never really had to confront it  so for what may be the first time in his life he is forced to realize he wasnt above ignorance  he couldnt admit he was in denial i guess in actuality it made him feel better not admitting his own foibles  once lenora finally decides to put race behind her and just accept his love porter himself begins to question his on beliefs and prejudices  mclaurin does a great job in mentioning the quotunmentionablesquot things about which we shouldnt discussthats one of the reasons why i enjoyed the book  the author does a pretty good job in dealing with some really tough issues that people refuse to address  and i enjoyed the fact that she allowed porter to do a great deal of soulsearching during this particular time in his life  each person in the relationship had to ask him or herself why they were with the other person  the answers werent so easythe beginning of the book was a little slow for my taste  and although i was pleased with the ending i expected a little more  overall i would definitely recommend the book  i cant wait to find out what other novels mclarin has written
this book was perfect in many ways it provided the reader an insight on how the people coming to the us from different countries such as india may feel and how hard it is as a child to grow up in two different cultures in that sense i thoroughly enjoyed the book the message of the book was a great life lesson but as i read through the novel the message seemed to be disappearing since the book follows the life of gogol the reader goes through all of his experiences and along the way learns about indias culture but gradually the lessons of the book turned into the devastating events that occur to the main character at that point of the novel i was becoming a little bored of the book the message was gone and now the story was just about the characters unfortunate experiences i trudged through the rest of the book and was actually content to see it endon a more positive note i would like to say that the writing of the author was great and interesting to read in that sense the ending though i will not give it away also summed up the book fantastically
i really enjoyed this not only is it an entertaining book but a wonderful thing to own as well bridging the gap between the narrative and the package is the structure of the novel
this book is so awesome for so many reasons  first of all the story is fascinating  it is extremely well written and captivating and is a true story  it is inspiring in the sense that the author was able to totally change his life  people often think that they are stuck and their is nothing that they can do to improve or change the quality of their life but the author proves that this is wrongthis book has personally inspired me to work on improving the quality of my life  i have started having more confidence i have been working on self improvement and recently attended a tony robbins motivational seminar which i never would have done before reading this bookreally the book is not just about pickup  it is about the benefits of using emersion to truly master something and being able to do more than you ever thought was possible  it is about the value of having mentors who are masters in the field  it is about thinking outside the box and trying new things  i recommend this book to all of my friends and it has changed my life for the better
this is an excellent book outlining the spiritual life of ronald reagan  a subject not generally covered by the secular media  this is also a book about his contribution to the fall of the berlin wall and the soviet union a must read for history buffs who want to know the rest of the story
this is a masterpiece  some of the technology is long in the tooth but this book is simply fantastic on multiple levels
amy tan has again brought us into her world and culture this is the story of an asian daughter who has long since settled in the usa and her relationship with her americanized daughter who has never seemed to understand the woman within her mother it is only after ruth reads her mothers life story which has been written down for posterity that she begins to see the great struggles and difficult life her mother has survivedthe story is written with a magical hand and reads like a myth to be passed on and treasured by the family that follows there are many surprises for ruth along the way as she continues on her trek unveiling the source of much that has comes to passthis is a wonderful book i was able to listen to it as a book on tape and was highly entertained by the intonation of the voices and accents which made it so real an excellent choice i would give this book  stars  kelsana  
the year is  and  yearold griet is sent to work as a maid in the vermeer household where she is scorned by some and tolerated by others a wonderful portrayal of life in the times of the famous dutch artist as witnessed from the eyes of a young girl mesmerized by a greatness beyond her reachthough the author does not paint vermeer in a very favorable light he clearly portrays the egocentric expectations of a great master who is solely wrapped up in his work the characters are interesting and the story flows well to an ending that is to be expected it is the glimpse at human nature and the creative process of this great artist that is so enjoyable that and a young girls love and respect for her master a wonderful book  kelsana

an elegant intelligent and deeply creative work that delves into the nature of godhood in america american gods will have you falling in love with deities both common and exotic as you travel expanses of a beautifully rendered america with a deeply relatable protagonist
i started this book because i like all things to do with history and in particular anything up to and including elizabeth i  i admit at the beginning i struggled and several times almost gave up  why  the reasons stated in many of the reviews  the present tense the use of multiple names in a complex cast of characters the dialog alternating between using quotes and not are they thinking or speaking and finally  the worst annoyance  hehimhis  whothe dry wit and pithy delivery of much of the dialog is captivating  at those moments the characters come to life in a way i have rarely seen before for anne boleyn
there are very few books that i reread  this is one of them  it is my staple my goto book
if you liked divergent you will like this just as much  the ending wasnt at all how i predicted it would be which i thought made it better because i found it to be unpredictable  yep i loved it
the best childrens stories are the ones that dont look down their nose at kidsthis classic story does notin the story a discarded velveteen rabbit experiences the joys and sadnessess that i believe have been dealt with by every child sooner or laterhaving an identity and knowing oneselfwith the help of other wise toys he believes that if loved enough that he will become realwhich he attributes to a magical forcesadly hes almost burned when his owner comes down with scarlet fever but instead becomes the benifactor of genuine magicbecomming a real rabbitmaryl streep does a decent job at narrating this story and the use of more photographicarty animation is very refreshingeven though it has a happy ending the story above all things shows how little children can come to appreciate their toys and after watching this i had a hard time getting rid of christmas toys as years went buyin fact ive kept many of themi think every child should see this and they will luckily come to appreciate more as they get olderit has alot of heart and meaning
strange things have happened with the reviews of this book  ive read through  reviews sorted by most helpful  overall numbers of  reviews and s are almost equal but the vast majority of the top  are s  clearly the  reviewers  the antifans  are more diligent in approving each others reviewsand there are odd similarities between many of the antifan reviews  an inability to spell the word too keeps cropping up  perhaps its just a coincidence that so many fans share a common illiteracy  or sockpupptry  edit added on  april people have commented that this paragraph is offensive  it wasnt intended a to offend anyone
ive read about a hundred hostile reviews of this book and i just dont agreeive just finished reading the first four books and ill read dance with dragons when it comes out in paperback in a few weeks  i enjoyed feast just as much as the first threespoilers followit was great to see more of cersei  the schemes and sharp tongues of the three queens  cercei margaery and olenna  were a highlight of the book for me  i hope we see more of olenna  for those who mainly want bloody battles political intrigues may not be as exciting but i enjoyed themthe focus on cersei also redressed an imbalance in the earlier books  too often we had seen the good characters such as eddard stark brought down by their errors of judgement while the bad ones always triumphed  now we see cersei making a few errors of her owni thought the focus on a smaller group of characters in this book was fine  there are a lot of different points of view now and too many makes it hard to follow  there are enough different threads going on in westeros at this point of the story to constitute an interesting book without needing to keep darting off to essos or the wallmany reviews criticized the brienne storyline too much wandering around without achieving her designated objective  its hard to see why this should be a surprise since its exactly what arya did for the whole of storm of swords  it shows us whats happening all over westeros which is the intent and it worksothers have criticized the introduction of more ironborn and dornish characters  again this shouldnt have been unexpected  its how the whole series has operated  just when we thought the starks and lannisters were the main focus clash of kings required us to take stannis and his retinue on board  then storm of swords threw in the tyrells  so there should be no shock that another book expanded the cast even further  anyway how anyone who loves martins world could see the iron islands or dorne on the map a not wonder what is going on there is beyond mefinally many reviewers seem to want closure  i dont think that will happen  this is not a quest with a natural end  the ring gets thrown into the mountain of fire and ushers in a new age of peace and plenty  rather its a history  and history never really finishes  but for those of you who want it heres the ending youre aftertyrion sped off to meereen where he met up with dany and told her all about the political disruption in westeros  dany immediately realized the time to strike was now
very wordybut than perhaps describing  finding the killers takes a lot of talking and descriptionyou know who it was from the beginning as the book starts with the killers introduced to youbook was not a exciting thriller but a unfortunate tale of family discordwith a mean miserable father who played favorites with his boysno wonder they wanted to get rid of himmother was a weak character
i consider myself a reformed atheist i used to think that religion was just outdated moral codes an easy way to repress others and your own emotions and desires an excuse to do bad things to people of other religions a reason to never have to think for yourself and a great way to deny and frown upon actual scientific data but now i see the light this book has changed my point of view fsm is real

in this book neil comins walks a fascinating tightrope between science and science fiction  he presents ten carefully detailed scenarios in which intriguing astronomical quotwhat ifsquot are asked  each scenario is alloted about  or  pages on average  the title scenario dealing with a posited earth without a moon is the longets essay weighing in at  pagesone of my favorite sections is the chapter pondering quotwhat ifquot the earth were struck by a black hole  comins generously approaches this question from two completely distinct vantage points  first he asks what would happen if we were hit by a stellar mass black hole  second he delves into how things might be if we were hit by a primordial black hole formed at the beginning of the universe with a mass about the same as that of the moon  comins also asks great questions about how things might be if a local star went supernova how the earth might fare  if the moons orbit was closer to us and what earthly life might be like if the earth were tilted on its axis perpendicular to its orbit like uranusthis book is really interesting  it isnt exactly science fiction  just speculation  comins sticks very close to known science with no departures at all  when necessary he includes little essays about stephen hawkings theories etc to help us understand the sound foundation of his theorizingif you know any quotabsentminded professorquot children or an adult with a bent in this direction then i recommend the living daylights out of this book to clarify that  the highest praise i can give this book is that i wish i discovered it when i was about  years old  i remember my summer vacations when i was about that age when my friends would plant me in deep deep deep left field during whiffleball games  i had to at least go out in the field to save face but i usually wanted to be thinking about science  whichever team was actually at bat i was the designated deepcubed left fielder for the duration of the game  id sit there and daydream and mumble to myself about astronomy or fantasy until my friends eventually let me know when the game was over  one summer i spent those afternoons thinking about quotthe lord of the ringsquot  another summer it was carl sagans quotdragons of edenquot which i also recommend  another summer it was the science chapters from quotthe book of listsquot  this book would have been just as fascinating and would have kept me happily spaced out in dreamland for months  in my book thats high praise  i would also recommend this for science teachers at any level from elementary school to high school  two thumbs way up
this is a consistently intriguing collection of autobiographical sketches  mr crichton has done some serious travelling in his time around our planet and also inward metaphorical travels  his journeys are either to rarely visited geographical locales such as various obscure himalayan kingdoms premassacre rwanda  hong kong or to even more rarely visited xfilesish  states of mind  where spoons are bent with sheer concentration the human aura is visible and the future can be seeni wasnt sure what i thought about some of the more mystical explorations he undertakes here but the older i get the more openminded i am to things like that  he really comes across as being honest and quite psychologically perceptive  if you liked his novel  quotspherequot this will give you a sense of the kind of thought processes that gave rise to the interesting ending of that story  also i should say if you liked quotcongoquot be on the lookout for various scenes here that clearly influenced the writing of that book  i wont give them away herein general i have to say that many of the more spiritual components of this book are some of the most accessible interesting and provocative passages on the nature of consciousness ive ever had the pleasure of reading  he makes you really think about the mind and how we use it or fail to use it  he uses plain unacademic language to describe experiences that are too often shrouded in mumbojumbo words like quotepistemelogicalquot or quotphenomenologicalquot  anyone can read this book and anyone who thinks about it can profit from it  two thumbs up
ursula leguin has so much quoton the ballquot its almost frightening  this book is all about the way dreams shape our world they really do if you think about it  america was founded on dreams and also about when dreaming can become problematic  her hero has the giftcurse of being able to change the physical universe by dreaming and because his dreams come from his unconsious mind he has no control over them whatsoever  he seems to find that maybe its best just to sort of muddle through not basing his worldtransforming dreams on judgments about whether things are absolutely optimal or not  its funny but if you read studies on the nature of creativity they tend to agree with what shes saying  if you can relax the mind and let things just come to you your dreams and ideas will flow a heck of a lot more naturally than if you try to force them into some mold  and they wont be very negative dreams either theyll be useful to you and to othersalso this book is just packed with taoism just like her earthsea trilogy  if you study this at all youll find that the way she uses taoism to work against regimented social planning actually has had many real life counterparts which have occurred over the centuries in china  there have always been major philosophical differences there between the philosophically freespirited taoists and the hardnosed statecentered confucianists and of course the buddhists have always fit in in various complex ways too in a funny way this book can be a good introduction to a lot of people to the ways issues have historically been framed in that part of the world  china is expected to become a more familiar part of americas world as time goes by so maybe this book can play a part in that  just a thought  if anyones interested quota concise history of chinaquot by jag roberts is a good introduction to chinese history  youll see what i meanand beyond all that the woman knows how to tell a story  whew  two thumbs up
this book was a complete surprise and wonderful  it is extremely well written and engaging  the approach is refreshing and full of insights into both the history of ireland and the mindset of the irish with an understanding of how the history affected the accumulative mind set  wonderful book
save your money this dead tree is not worth itthe plot barely moves forward at all at the expense of hours of your life formerly mine martin must have been counseled more characters means more pages means more money there can be no artistic reason to have filled us in on the amatory yes
there are few books that change ones life don quixote is one of them that did it for me i can see why this book is a hundredsyear old classic tale reading this book illuminated for me that human nature never changes i resisted reading this book for years but it came during a time of my life that i needed a change and i finally caved in its like a fine scotch at first you dont appreciate it until youve held it in your hand and slowly and carefully sipped it while finally enjoying the rich experience it shed an understanding of how crazy people really are there were people in my life that were just like don quixote they even shared similar lies of visiting a mystical underground crystal palace like don quixote did i understood for the first time people want to feel special and chosen in some way men want to be heros and will go to great lengths  even by lying  to feel it this translation is the best one out there
the narrow focus of what the th is most famous for is wonderful because it allows for many details  for those that dont know they took atrocious casulaties over a  hour period basically  out of  men went down  their action is legendary lining up against the unions most famous iron brigade and also being the unit that could claim the farthest penetration into enemy territory on day as always a couple of more maps would have been extremely helpful but that being said the ones there are well doneday  is treated extremely well with intense description of the action almost minute by minute as far the th was concerned  the reading is smooth however and most wont get lost in the detailsday  has some of the best coverage that i have read because the author expands the focus for the picketpettigrewtrimble charge to cover many of the other units involved  of course the th still gets the lions share of the commentarythis book isnt for novices but at the same time you dont need to be a hardcore student to get it  i think a simple  or  page synopses of the battle will help so you dont get bogged down with some of the names but more so you understand the importance of the battle in an overall perspectiveagain the focus is the th at gettysburg with a very brief prelude and wrap up to their other action  highly recommended for the acw afficionada and casual readermy only little quibble is with the quality of paper and tiny font for the paperback  come on publishers put the better works on better paper so theyll last longer
in judging all civil war campaign books and obviously gettysburg specific i believe for most people the standard is coddington  at least as far as the one volume treatments go  imo trudeaus book is as close to codds and in many cases even better  i have read about  acw books so far this year yes you read that correctly and so far this ranks in the top here are my reasons publishers seem not to understand the importance of maps in complicated actions  you may now rest in peace  this book features map upon map in timely locations and showing you the pertinent action  true a couple of them are almost microscopic but i will not fault for giving them to us  id rather use a magnifying glass then turn the battle into a jumble beause of all the different units  maps get   commentary  very neutral and well paced  true it can be a bit dry but i like the flow  i like the short sequences and jumping around from place to place to show you what exactly is going on at that very moment elsewhere  codds is more analytical describing possible reasons pros and cons etc for the movements but theres nothing wrong with trudeaus  a different more generic style  very friendly to newbies  more of a pure telling of what exactly happened and not so much why it happened bibliography is tremendous  although there are not specific notations more of a general wrap up in the back of sources referenced for each chapter in many cases there are traditional footnote mentions to clarify terminology or what appear to be contradictions  also something i havent seen elsewhere during certain actions he notes soldiers who won medal of honors for their service that dayin short this is a must read for gb fans and i would highly recommend as your first campaign read whether it be for gb or just in general  this should become the new standard on how to write and map a book on a civil war campaign  coddington for me still holds the edge but just barely because of its thought provoking prose style  i think both books work well togetherto simplify coddington gives you more of the strategicanalytical blow by blow trudeau gives you a lot more detail many regimental accounts
i teach school and ordered this book form my classroom library  the girls love to read it and it is always gone from the shelves
this book follows the life of a group of young girls it covers their wartime work their financial struggles bits of romance thrown in and of course life during the blitz it is a mixed book sometimes funny sometimes grim and tragic deaths of family and friends worth a read
i bought this book yesterday morning and stayed up until  reading it it was a great read i loved the character development i was rooting for claire i despised james and got nervous every time a scene involved helen my particular favorite part was claires description of being a waitress that was so accurate and hilariousi grew a little impatient at the end and must admit that i skipped a lot of claires self talk and scanned the text for quote marks so i could get through it faster but i have already bought this for someone else ive recommended it to everyone at work and hope to read lucy sullivan next sunday thank you ms keyes
the land is in chaos  war rules the streets one thing remains the same it is always the children who pay  we watch king james white learn of his destiny draw his knightlike supporters close and try to do the right thing by his peoplewhat else is a king supposed to doi deeply enjoyed this book  while you dont have to be familiar with the arthur legend you may derive pleasure from figuring out whos who and the parts theyll play  while the names have changed the souls are the same recast in roles that make sense for our time  the writing is sharp and figures of legend dance across the landscape of a notnearlycompletelyfantasy indianapolis most suburbanites would prefer to ignore  i particularly loved the characterization of the green knight powerbehindthethrone ganglord green and the chilling pair of cannibalistic enforcer trolls in a verrry small car  moreover the dialogue is zippy funny and believabletake a break from conventional urban fantasy  try king maker  youll thank me
historical fiction plus a modern thriller incredible humor and even some mathematics and technology  youll love the characters worry about them laugh with them but mostly root for them  stephensons best work
whatever happened to the french novel  there was the immediate postwar era when once could read camus sartres postnausea novels
this is the first in a series of a books guided by renowned leftwing historian howard zinn which seek to tell the peoples history of the various eras of american history  and there is a real need for a synthesis of leftwing scholarship on the american revolution to contrast with the excessively military focus of robert middlekaufs the glorious cause and gordon woods the radicalism of the american revolution  this book unfortunately is not it  it has little original research largely consisting of a few contemporary newspapers and it is heavily reliant on a few works of scholarship  more important the focus is limited  that raphael did not feel the need to provide a narrative of the american revolution from the stamp act crisis to the ratification of the american constitution is his privilege  instead he has separate chapters on rebels soldiers women loyalists and pacifists native americans and african americans  we have many anecdotes of the difficult struggles these people had and it is noteworthy that raphael emphasizes female passivity and unenthusiasm and provides a sympathetic picture of the loyalist and pacifist minority i think the one useful thing i learned from this book was that john adams oftcited quotation that a third of americans were prorevolution a third were against it and a third were neutral was not made about the american revolution but the french one but there is a lack of real analysis  many of the anecdotes go on and on giving the book a cut and paste feelmoreover there is the rather bland populism of the conclusion quotthe people of the revolution had become playersquot the rather bland and pompous liturgy on p  starting quotpeople make history complex human beings from varying circumstances who pull together drive apart and interact in countless waysquot  it reminds of what is missing in this account  there is no real discussion of the revolutions origins nor is there much on the economy  there is no engagement with michael merrills argument that the american colonies were not really capitalist at all nor with timothy breens theory that the revolution marked the triumph of a consumerist revolution  what were the living standards of the people before the revolution or after it  how did they live  what was the economic impact of the revolution  there is little or nothing on ideology  the whole question of republicanism and the sprouting of democratic theory the concurrent rise of abolitionism and an explicitly racist logic to slavery there is no clear discussion of these issues  there is scandalously little on religion  the largest discussion deals with the pacifist sects whose opposition to war put them in conflict with the revolutionary authorities  but once again there is nothing on popular religiosity and popular indifference  while there is much on struggle and conflict there is little on politics on political organization or such political questions as civil liberties  finally there is not enough on the consequences of the revolution  was the revolution ultimately conservative  was the revolution sui generis or part of an unfolding modernity was it comparable to the french revolution or was it fundamentally dissimilar  again raphael provides no answers and we have to ask ourselves whether this series of peoples history is going to collapse into a sentimental populism
to outsiders the history of early modern spain appears as a story of decline  on the one hand spain from  onwards was one of the largest empires in history ranging from naples to manilla controlling much of germany and italy as well as what is now holland and belgium  it was responsible for destroying two great urban civilizations the aztec and the inca and for shattering the culture and society of an entire hemisphere  yet after the defeat of the spanish armada the history of the empire appears to be a slow and agonizing decline while spain itself turned from being the feared master of europe to a poor isolated peripheryit is the virtue of henry kamens book that he shows this to be an illusion  kamen is one of the leading historians of spain and the last decade has been a prolific one for him since he has also written an important study of the counterreformation in catalonia biographies of philip ii and philip v as well as a revision of his book on the spanish inquisition  in kamens new book he shows that spain was always a poor country on the periphery of europe  how then did it dominate much of the world  the short answer is that it didnt really and it had a lot of help to dominate what it didpeople tend to think that the marriage of ferdinand and isabella created a united spain  not true  what it did was create a system in which the various territories and regions that made up spain were ruled by a common monarch  but each region as well as much of the rest of the spanish empire had its own sets of privileges and local assemblies  no unified spanish state existed in  and would not for centuries to come  the result was that spain had no coherent bureaucracy and could never have formed its vast armies on its own resources and populations  it relied heavily on foreign mercenaries  belgians were crucial to the success at st quentin in the s the italians for the victory at lepanto in the s  the spaniards made up only a sixth of the soldiers ruling italy in  italy  the guarani indians under the jesuit missions made famous in the rather inaccurate film the mission
giving one star to arthur hertzbergs latest meditations on the israeliarab conflict may be a little harsh  the book does after all support a twostate solution and hertzberg does suggest that the united states should very tactfully pressure israel to evacuate its west bank settlements  and the book does start off with hertzberg attending a  labour party conference which heard david bengurions desperate plea that the conquered territories should be given backand ignored it  but this book offers nothing valuable to the discussion  what it does say is uninformed and disingenuous  the print is large and the footnotes are few  essentially hertzberg argues that while a twostate solution would be a good idea the problem is that the palestinians will not accept it  hertzberg claims that israel and moderate liberal zionists like himself wished to negotiate but were always rebuffed by the arabs  i dont agree  lets ignore the fact that sharon has not only arrogated the right to choose which palestinians he will negotiate with but also the right to kill them  lets leave aside the fact that when hertzberg quotes a poll saying that twothirds of israelis would support a withdrawl of israeli settlements he ignores the same poll saying that twothirds of palestinians would support a palestine confined to the  conquered areasthe real problem is that a sincere negotiator seeks a certain limited empathy or at the very least genuine curiosity about the other side  one tries to understand the opposing sides arguments and if one does not accept them one at least acknowledges their existence and makes an intellectually honest effort to refute them  there is almost nothing of that in hertzbergs book  there is no real discussion of palestinian society or its culture or its complexities what we get are a series of threatening personifications  hetzberg provides a standard brief liberal account of israel which simply repeats its side of the story  he almost completely ignores the other side of the story on such issues as the british mandate the willingness of jews to migrate to palestine the nature of the  war the origins of the palestinian refugee crisis postindependence diplomacy or the sixday war  it is enough simply to list the many scholars whose existence he ignores  donald neff avi shlaim norman finkelstein rashdid khalidi janet and abraham abulughod idith zertal peter novick simha flapan tom segevthere are other weaknesses  at one point hertzberg attributes to noam chomsky opinions today that chomsky held thirty years ago  he does not mention the fact that palestinians make up a large majority of the dead of the second intafada  hertzberg does mention such crimes as deir yassin and the sabra and shatilla massacres but not the obvious fact that the people responsible or complicit in these and other crimes were not only not punished but won and still win high political office  he rightly supports a secular future for both israel and palestine but his account of it is disingenuous and apologetic  there is no analysis of palestinian chiliasm aside from an innate refusal to understand israel  as for the problem of israeli sectarianism hertzberg suggests that after the  war some israelis adapted messianic beliefs and unhelpfully encouraged the settlers  he does not discuss the special privileges granted by the state to orthodoxy notwithstanding the fact that it represents only a minority of world jewry or the refusal to allow civil marriage  we see clicheacutes such as the argument that there are so many countries worse than israel  true but we heard these arguments in the eighties when the soviet union and apartheid south africa were still around  true but americans would not glibly tolerate denmark or costa rica carrying out similar brutalities  true but american aid supports israel as it does not in burma or syria or north korea  true but the syrian government does not come to my synagogue to solicit money from me  it is embarrassing that a rabbi should be so complacent  but then many american liberals believe that the best way to encourage liberalism among the palestinians is to keep them under semipermanent house arrest
this was a fitting way to end the series losses to overcome and hope for tomorrow looking forward to the movies
i was truly enjoying this book as it began  i am always drawn more to character driven romances than those powered by a mystery or event  my problem with the book is that the plot changes midstory  robert is a tortured hero in the beginning having debilitating panic attacks and unable to converse with his family  in a matter of a few weeks though the whole story took no more than a few weeks from start to finish hes completely overcome these problems fallen in love and solved the mystery of who framed him  im afraid i just dont buy it  i wish ms enoch had just focused on robert and lucindas relationship and left the mystery for another story it didnt meld well with this one to add this element she had to resolve roberts problems much too quickly
i know im going to aggravate most die hard clancy fans by giving this three stars but hey its an ok book  could have been about  pages less and still got his point across i did like how kelly took out an entire gang with ease throughout the book it just seemed like there was too much going on for all this to be believable though come on the guy is planning a raid on a vietnam pow camp like the real life bo gritz and at the same time is putting away the local bloods and crips with a k barthis book would have gotten a better rating for me if less time was spent on the rehab of a drug addict and more time spent on the pow camp raid i had no idea before reading this book that it was also about american pows so that was a nice surprise all that buildup for well i dont want to spoil anything but there only about  pages out of the  that dealt with the snatch of that russian officer i think that in the time frame we were dealing with the local cops wouldnt have cared much if a guy was wasting the local drug dealers maybe in todays world they would have to put on a dog and pony show with interviews and the whole nine after pressure from civil rights but not in the late s early sin the end this book falls short of explaining to the reader exactly why clark is the special opscovert guy he is today
ive been enjoying the flashman series from my local library and was looking forwards to the kindle edition but  is just too expensive to make it worthwhile id pay  but not more also has kindle figured out how to implement the notes feature such that its easy to use for the print books the notes are key to connecting the fiction and the fact and you have to be able to easily jump back and forth earlier kindle books werent too good at this and i hope that this has been addressed in this series
i found this book was hard reading  it jumped from one thing to another i was disappointed with the book  hopefully the next book in the alex cross series isnt hard reading
excellent reading every chapter got my attention to the point of not wanting to put the book down i really believed someone else did the damage i was amazed of the outcome
another good book they seem to get better with more suspense each time didnt have a clue who done it surprised me again
this was the perfect dictionary for my th grade daughter  the words arent too tiny the definitions are well written and easy to understand  great for the whole family really
i had these books as a child and they were my favorite books  i read them again and again even as an older child  my favorite of the four books is chicken soup with rice which i can recite from memory to my almost  year old daughter  she also loves these books and asks me to read them again and again  the small size was part of the appeal to me as well as the simple yet adorable pictures
the concept of the series is cute but the clean their rooms eat their food and play with their friends are to me the best titles  the others are overkill
excellent read this mystery starts off fast and is fast moving unlike many which i would call a straight line mystery this one has several twists and turns the frictionattraction between molly doyle and the chief of police add spice to the bookbooks like this i tend to read twice first scanning through descriptions quickly to keep up with the action and a second time to pick up the fine points i missed on the first pass do not start this book on a workschool night as you wont want to put it down the just one more chapter will extend to the next chapter and the nextthere is one downside to this book however there are only a few in the series
every person who buys manufactured products from vitamin supplements to cosmetics should read this book  quote posh cosmetics are a special self administered voluntary tax on people who dont understand science properly  people dont buy expensive cosmetics because they are more effective but because they are luxuary goods and a status item  find out how you are wasting your money
i dont play tennis so i didnt understand much of the action with the tennis matches i still rather enjoyed this autobiography by andre agassi i like that he didnt always win and chronicling the rivalry between he and pete sampra was really fun to read i think that he is a great writer i really loved his analogies and similes i wonder why he even married brooke shield i am going to watch that handlicking scene in friends again
love all the joe grey books  just discovered them recently  intriguing author has an  amazing imagination  keep them comingdone
i wouldnt recommend this book as an introduction to buddhism and its teachings  for that i would turn to smith and novaks introductionbuddhism a concise introductionor yongey mingyur rinpoches joy of livingthe joy of living unlocking the secret and science of happiness  lopez is indeed a scholar and provides here a pleasant and erudite archaeological survey of buddhist practice and organization with a particular focus on the legends that animate these practices  oddly he recounts these legends mostly as fact  he has a particularly strong focus on esoteric tibetan buddhist rituals and also on pure land philosophy  not all readers will find these particularly relevant  his text is clear and will probably appeal most to intermediate or advanced readers who wish to get a further grounding in buddhist philosophical history
well being the rd review listed here on amazon for this book there probably isnt too much that hasnt already been said by the average reader about this book  having read this and other hemingway novels for my th grade honors english class and a subsequently painful paper i can honestly say i enjoyed this a lot more than i did back then at age  or however old i was at the timemy little book group read this onewell read anything
an unusual ficitionalized account of hitlers bizarre relationship with his much younger niece this book is filled with insights albeit imagined into many of the other main players in hitlers reich  hitler is percieved as strange even by his own familyhis halfsisters halfbrother nieces nephewscousins etcsure the dialogue and happenings are embellished or completely imagined by the authorincluding the speculative and shocking ending of this story and this relationship  seeing how he would treat an innocent member of his own family one who is so much younger and should have earned nothing but his protection is so insightful considering his devious master plan and how successful it finally waswell the whole thing is heartbreaking  hitler is portrayed as someone with no compassion no real heart and a sick soul who took no joy in life at alli liked this book to some extent but did find it a little nightmarish towards the end  hitlers minions behavior is sickening but  i can only assume it cant be too far from the truth  and his evilness comes through in this storyregardless of what really happened one night in the luxery apartment hitler shared with his niece  he certainly always chose to not do the right thing  a horrifying time to be german or a eurpean for that matter
our book group is reading truth and beauty by ann patchett and decided to read autobiography of a face as well and i am glad we did  lucy grealy writes her painful story from age  and we are with her every step of the way through her many painful ordealslucy is a seemingly normal  year old child growing up in a disjointed and admittedly dysfunctional family  she is diagnosed with ewings sarcoma a cancer with an alrmingly low survival rate  although she has a twin sister she rarely talks about her  you get the impression the family is not close nor are they very supportive of one another  when her father is hospitalized for a serious illness lucy only goes to see him one time  although the stay is extensive they just stay at home waiting for phone updates on their fathers condition  only her mother seems to make many appearances at the hospital where lucy spends the majority of her prepubescent yearslucy grealy is a person who is obssessed with her appearance  she talks about not really knowing who she is and what she looked like before her surgery therefore her post surgery appearance is the defining one for her  she is grossly disfugured not only by the cancer and the resulting surgeries and treatments but by the many surgeries performed in an attempt to repair the damage  unfortunately no clear thinking adult ever steps forward to get this poor child any kind of counseling or therapy and she spends much of her life tortured by secret shame  she strives to be strong enough to make her mother proud to be the model patient and to portray herself as a person who really doesnt care about her appearancence  sadly as most women know this is not the case especially in a society obsessed by appearancesin my review of truth and beauty i refer to the article lucy grealys sister suellen wrote in reaction the the publication of that book  my question to the grealy family would be where were all of you  i understand the family had many problems but to be angry at patchett and the other friends of lucys who were their for her when her own family wasnt seems misplaced  especially because the publication of this book precedes that of this book  and lucys own book is clearly an indictment of the disinterest of the grealy familythis is the life story of an extremely unhappy and disturbed person  she needed serious therapy to deal with her serious physical illness and all its side effects  sadly she was neglected in this way  yes through her writing and many of her relationships some healthy most not she found a way in the world but if you read truth and beauty and learn of the rest of her life through the eyes of a bystander you see the personality that develops from the pain that was her early life  well written and fast moving this lucys book is a different kind of story than any other you will ever read  brutally honest and excuciatingly sad lucy seemed to believe all she was was a face and the only way to true happiness was to be loved and adored by a lover  if only she was able to embrace herself as so much more than just a face
this book seems perfect for a light read  it has catchy characters and an okay plotactually dont read this even as a light read unless you enjoy the guilty pleasure of reading novels with way too many adverbs  monstrous regiment is completely formulaic
such a disappointing end to the otherwise excellent trilogy i wish i hadnt read this book i would have been better off using my imagination to decide how it all ended i wont be buying the four series now as a result of this book im done giving money for something so ridiculous
i enjoyed this book  kind of predictable in many ways  it comes insecond to the lowland but im glad i read it
i really enjoyed learning about rachels life before duing and after rehab she is such a funny lady unfortunately her self image sucks and obviously brings her undoing  luke and chris are beautiful distractions and make you fall in love with love againi hope you enjoy this book as much as i did
i have not read this book yet but love the ease of the kindle and receiving books this way  thanks
this is an interesting look at the clash of two worlds the old world of edwardian england  settled classridden and at the pinnicle of power  and also weary cynical and snobbish into this new world comes a man from the new  that world of frontier america rough and ready accustomed to lawlessness and violence  and also a little naive the mr american of the title has a mysterious past
really great series overall i fell in love with the characters and while i really enjoyed the booksid say out of the three this one was the least exciting you have to read it to finish out the series but dont expect to be as spellbound as you were in books  and 
this is one of my favorite books i first read this book while in middle school and have reread it so many times that i can recite some of the passages the story of the girl who leaves her island home and must adjust to the harsh new england environment struck a chord with me as i was a military kid and always moving from place to place this story is about a girl who finds herself in a new environment that goes against everything she has ever learned or experienced and she must learn who she is in order to survive this new land its also a romance story and an intriguing story that shows what can happen when people become so closedminded about what is right and proper that they refuse to look past a persons supposed subversive actions in order to really see or understand that person  highly recommended reading
i read this book many years ago and did not even realize that it was part of a series until recently i bought the other books in the series and was expecting the other books to be similar to this writing style while the other three books in the series are good stories and entertaining reading it is the lives of christopher chant that is the best of the series this book has more depth and humor than the other books in the series i devoured this book in one setting
read it decide for yourselfthis is not a lite read but you can work your way through it nor is it quotjunk sciencequot as one ignorant reviewer claims even most of his well credentialed critics agree that he has done his homework they just disagree about his conclusionsthis is an interesting journey into the complexity of what darwin thought of as the quotsimplequot building blocks of life and asks uncomfortable questions of those who think they have the final answer in regards to originsthis book asks questions that the darwin communitys high priests and disciples find very objectionable and threatinging note the shrill tone and hand waving of most negative reviews on this site it is interesting to note that many of the attacks use character assination as their primary means of discrediting the book straw man arguments to defeat positions the author never took to begin with or even more amusing warning you not to read this stuff least you be some how warped by the proecess heresy disgusting reallymany in the academic world despite their protestations have never handled challenges well many are cowards some are simply protecting turf and others are quottrue believersquot all of these types are more than willing to burn any and all quotwitchesquot that challenge any of their cherished worldview ideas examine scientific history to discover how closed minded the majority are things we take for granted today were laughed at and ridiculed by the quotcommunitiesquot of their timesstill like any profession there are a minority of real thinkers that examine ideas for their worth and not their possible consequences sound ideas usually overcome given time and i think behes will follow that pattern and play out historically if not currentlyi have also read the quotrealquot critiques  vs those copied verbatim by lesser fellows here  and the rebuttals to them i find the interaction and ideas between the pro and con sides of this debate quite challenging and enlightenting see the authors and critics web sites for more informationread this book and judge for yourselves some will simply acceptreject the work because of their own biases others will digest and analyze the pointcounterpoints of the critics and proponents and come to their own conclusions as i and i hope you will do

despite criticism of its quotharshly realisticquot dialogue and the rather simple outer layer to the plot a farewell to arms has emerged as one of the greatest war story ever written known for his wealth of  experience gained in the brutality of battlefields hemingway gained  instant fame with his highly autobiographical tale of a tenuous love caught  in the sweeping wave of wwiset in italy the story unfolds when a  young american ambulance driver henry meets a gorgeous english nurse  catherine berkley for the first time perhaps it was due to the powerful  binding hands of the war that berkley confides in henry of her tragic love  and places instant faith in him at first henry regards catherine only as  an unwonted addition to his foreign quotepisodesquot after he convinces  himself that this feeling of strong attraction is only the ramification of  war of loneliness and of the desire to share ones misery with someone  else yet as their affair progresses especially after henry was wounded  and put on covalence leave he begins to see the sparkle of his passion for  catherine expands into this glowing fire of love war is a vital component  in henry and catherines relationship as they plot their future together  with war as their perpetual constraint they only lean on one another more  when henry was forced to return to the front after learning catherine is  pregnant the irony of their love is the shared conviction that their  affair is in some way a representation of matrimony refusing to marry  henry after he has learnt of her pregnancy catherine urges henry to go  back to where he belongs during the retreat henry deserts the army in  order to escape the persecution that awaits all officers fleeing back to  the side of his love ready to sacrifice his life in order to be with her  henry prepares catherine for the journey of their lives the ending set in  a swedish hospital is by no means a reconciling quotperiodquot to the  long sentence with few commas evenhemingways own tragic romance is  beautifully depicted by the movie made from agnes wienskys novel in love  and war in some way despite occasional righteousness and victors  justice war is an opening to the broader side of natures hideousness  wars are not meant to be sweet and gentle even if they are enshrouded with  the divine touch of patriotism and of love henry and catherine had grace  under the soaring siege of wwi because they didnt just observe the  ongoing war as a superfluous event but as a contagion of fear from which  they must flee and in fact they do flee to freedom through hemingways  laconic and rough narration few insights emerges above the surface yet  what his pen doesnt convey on the surface is an even deeper well that  awaits discovery and understanding and that is the reality apart from the  polish plane of prosesome asks if the setting has been different  could a farewell to arms have been culminated by a more jovial ending that  may in some way capture the triumphant nature of love after all we as a  species do rise above history more often triumphant than not but  hemingway is not only a survivor of two wars he is also the keeper of  poignant memories of his own love loss it doesnt necessarily mean that  henry and catherines love was killed by warit was finished by fate their  love never died it is immortal in the sense that their tale is an ongoing  story without end their love is as great as love can be even without  ornamental phrases fictional lovers whisper in each others ears one  gesture one glance one word is enough to convince each other as well as  the readers how strong the war has made them to be as onemen make  war true enough for most of hemingways works but also more  significantly wars make men hemingway is one of those who were certainly  made stronger by not only triumph but also losses in the hands of fate and  of self
kingsolver after the successful bean trees shifts gear to conquer a little piece of the unknown in this  best seller set in a congo struggling for then with its new identity  caught in the dramatic events  such as kantagas secession mysterious death of congos first prime  minister and cia entanglement is a disillusioned georgia family  tyrannized by a devout evangelical baptist father against the backdrop of a  dazed black africa  the first half of poisonwood bible dedicates itself to  description of a serene village called kilanga where nathan price rooted  his family which remains superficially unchanged as the world around it  changes faces  despite the banality of fanatical preachers we have had in  this half of the century kingsolver approaches the racist supremacist  chauvinistic father price with an uneasy tenderness revealed in narration  by his pessimistic and neurotic wife oreleanna as well as their four  daughters who come to represent the different extremities that are to ail  and be ailed by congo  as nathan becomes possessed with the religious  fervor that pushes his family closer to the pit of ignorance and death the  natives prove themselves true kindred spirits and save the family despite  nathans attempt to force kilanga into marriage with christianity  the  first half ends in an exodus which is only one of many vivid biblical  allusions pervading this bible  the soothing tone of voice takes a sudden  turn as readers are forced to draw attention away from the life and the  people the main weakness of this novel is indeed kingsolvers intense  intellectual storm in the second half that forces the reader to swallow  history  there is an awkwardness in the transition that provides no  continuity in the natural progress of the four sisters and the mother  frank but shallow rachel competitive but dogmatic leah philosophical but  morbid adah and young but so very young ruth may and an ailing mother too  scarred by the devastation of congos burgeoning aberration as a young  independent country under western shadow still  almost similar to war and  peace except tolstoy was brilliant at picking up the thread kingsolver  devotes the second half to reflections of her own political views through  voices of different characters that the magnitude of ideas and opinions  come as an astounding force to push the unique intimacy established  previously between the readers and characters completely awaybut  despite its faults as an almost propagandized political novel the  poisonwood bible is a great read for what it evokes in you arrays of  characters come fusing into the grand panaroma of congo to help shape a  fragile yet stern frame of the human resilience  do overlook kingsolvers  effort to quotreeducatequot leahs defense of communism may seem  tiresome at the end but one thing is certain that lurks behind every single  line kingsolvers great love for a country whose birth and growth are  hindered by what westerners continue to regard as phenomena  her clear  focus never did become hazy despite the verbose offence her latter half  hastes to thrash upon western imperialism and expansionism  perhaps africa  is a matter that demands far more folds then kingsolver does achieve an  impressive balance to capture the very essence of struggle at least  just  like disabled twin adah says in the book quotthe congo is only a long  path that takes you from one hidden place to anotherquot yield to the  beautiful language and rhythm to be guided and questioned history wise  read an encyclopedia for more accurate details
muirel grays furnace grabbed my attention quickly and held it captive  through the first quarter of the book unfortunately  i found my attention waning during the second and third quarters as the story moved too slowly for my taste and introduced some subplots that were somewhat disjointed andor uninteresting gray did  manage to recapture some of my attention and interest in the final quarter of the book but by this point i was as much interested in finishing it so i could move on to my next book as in finding out how the story ends  furnace could easily have been an  quotquot or possibly a quotquot with some necessary editing
there are good reasons why gone with the wind published  years ago is a classic among classics a pulitzer prize winner and has sold over  million copies in more than  countries the reasons are that it is an unparalleled monumental epic of the american south that is very rich in historical facts it has superbly developed unforgettable characters a narrarative that is so captivating that the reader will feel heshe is right there experiencing all that was going on and it truly stands the test of time i enjoyed reading it at least as much now and possibly more than when i first read it over  years ago while gone with the wind is often marketed as the greatest love story of our time
prior to reading lehanes last book moonlight mile i thought it was impossible for me to be disappointed in a book by a writer i considered to be a master in creating rich complex real world characters and dialogue that sounds fresh from the streets moonlight mile strongly shook the foundation of my thinkinghowever
ties that bind features lawyer amanda jaffe  returning from her harrowing experience in wild justice  to take on a case that no one will take the plot revolves around the owner of an upscale callgirl service accused of murdering a us senator and of his claiming to have proof of the existence of a secret society of powerful men who have banded together for a commonly held political agenda in typical margolin style the plot moves at a brisk pace and is laced with several twists and turns that will keep you guessing about what is to happen next unlike margolins earlier expertise however in creating multidimensional characters that you really care about i found amanda jaffe to be a little boring and without a lot of depth with the latter also being how i felt about many of the other characters in ties that bind having stated this criticism margolins books are always fun to read and keep the pages flying through your fingers if you are in the mood for a fastpaced book in which you can easily lose yourself ties that bind is one you should consider while it is not as good as many of margolins earlier books such as gone but not forgottern after dark heartstone and the last innocent man ties that bind is a book i think you will enjoy
in veritas lashners second novel featuring victor carl and company he proves that hostile witness was no fluke lashners characters are multidimensional and memorable his plot is welldeveloped with interesting subplots and his narrative style keeps the flow of the book moving along at a nice pace veritas is wellworth reading but it is not without some flaws lashner uses so many characters that it is hard at times to keep track of whos who to whom without a scorecard so to speak further it took a bit too long to tie together the complex main plot and subplots and some of the decriptive passages went on too long a little more editing would have made veritas even more enjoyable for me nonetheless lashner is one of the better writers in his genre today and im looking forward to reading the rest of his books
an excellent new book on an engaging new hobby drones for dummies covers everything one needs to consider buy and safely and legally usebr because the faa and other agencies regulate drone use the book carefully outline legal restrictions on drone use  all issues about buying using and safe use are included down to the safe disposal of lipo batteries  an excellent and interesting book
first this is a gorgeous book with beautiful photos of nearly every recipe  i would describe it as a vegetarianvegan cookbook leaning heavily toward alkalinity  why this description  there are  recipes by my count with about  that are nonvegan because they include ingredients like eggs feta chevre haloumi and goat or sheeps yogurt  dairy is of course acidic  but if you ignore those the roughly  that are left are either very alkaline or lean heavily toward alkalinity  vegan recipes are clearly marked with a symbol so theyre easy to spot  other notations are heart symbols indicating how alkalineforming an entry isbr br the recipes begin with a cleanse some juices a breakfast section followed by appetizers and soups salads and dressings main dishes snacks and breads and ending with desserts  ive tried two entreacutees tomato and mushroom dial plus spicy bean berbers with cajun wedges and superslaw  both are excellent  of the soups i loved the tomato coconut and chili as well as the white gazpacho  these recipes are both very flavorful  i havent tried the salads or the desserts because i have plenty of good salad recipes and i dont eat dessert  mainly i bought this book for some alkaline main dishes and soups  these did not disappoint mebr br theres only one thing that really bothered me about this cookbook  why did the authors choose to use xylitol as a sweetener and not stevia  web md warns that xylitol can cause diarrhea and is toxic to dogs  stevia is a safer substitute
i started reading this and just couldnt continue  i really dont like reading about not nice people i dont care how rich and famous they are
i highly recommend this book it is well written and has many colored photos it is about a late th century artist by the name of andrew clemens who created the most amazing sand art bottles that i have ever seen andrew clemens lived in the late th century and he not only had no formal education but was also both deaf and unable to speak a most inspirational story and artist  andrew clemens sand bottles are so amazing that no one has ever been able to replicate his work there are very few artists in history that can claims this the italian renaissance artist michelangelo being one of the few  the author did a great job conveying the feel of the time period and provided a voluminous number of colored photos that catalogue the many still surviving sand bottles  the chapter entitled masterpiece was amazing in that it covered andrew clemens most astounding work which sadly very few people have ever heard of
absolutely loved this book sarah price has done it again
good information  i am a beginner and this handbook is easy to follow
this is a remarkable first novelindeed its a remarkably fine novel irrespective of being the authors first as a political scientist and film buff ive been a fan of kirshners writing in those fields for years but its one thing to write elegantly insightful prose about the future of the international monetary system or the subtexts of film noir and very much another to craft a historical novel that is wryly funny romantic and exciting yet kirshner succeeds at it brilliantly for me urban flight gets just about everything right it presents a cinematically rich portrayal of new york city in the mids seen through the sympathetic eyes of the protagonist without sinking into lengthy or ponderous exposition the dialogue is witty and intelligent but never feels artificial the central plot about political corruption and journalism is clever and often surprising while the intersecting threads of music love and everyday life that make up the real fabric of the story are an absolute delight the book is packed full of exquisitely vivid moments exchanges and entire scenes like a classic movie whose best lines you find yourself repeating years later im tempted to mention some of my favorites but i dont want to diminish anyones enjoyment at encountering them in person for the first time
exactly what my grandson was looking for and a great price
a gift for my kiddo who loves this series  she read it in two days and was quite happy with it
dungeon world is a beer and pretzels rpg  there is nothing wrong with that and matter of fact it is a compliment  i have not seen a more accessible rpg in a long time  that said i also think it is better for short term games and lacks the mechanics to lend itself to extended campaignsbr br for casual gamers or inexperienced ones dungeon world is a really good game  you can learn the rules and start playing pretty quick  naturally there is always the preparation for a game that a gm will need to work on but there are less rules considerations so their story can be enabled  likewise players can have some say in the game with bonds mechanic gives the players to build a history with each other and adapt over time  the benefit here is players with bonds can have tangible in game benefitsbr br to do virtually anything is a d mechanic which i personally do not like but maybe for someone who has never played anything beyond monopoly it has a good feel  the problems are that there is not a lot of variance in rolls and that there are not very many modifiers to a roll  attacking an enemy always hits in some manner on a roll of  or higher same for picking a lock etc  what if the enemy is more difficult to hit or a lock is super complicated  the rules dissuade from adding modifiers but that almost has to happen  combat does not have an initiative system per se so adjudicating who goes first seems a bit random  likewise players looking forward to using miniatures might want to look elsewherebr br skills are pretty abstract other than a spew specific to a class what you can do with a pc is really based on stats  so the fighter who is not especially smart will probably not have a high intelligence so souting lore is probably going to be iffy for them  likewise a wizard with a low strength trying to defy danger by muscle will have a tough go of it  for advanced gamers this lack of boundary in classes might be frustrating but a big positive is it keeps the whole party engaged and able to participatebr br players can pick between  or so classes and each has a niche and on the surface there are lots of options  the deeper you look however the less options there are  want to be a different race  you do not want an animal companion  then you have to dive into house rules and for an inexperienced gamer that is a choice fraught with hazard  that said if you stick with ordering what is on the menu there are enough options to make it interesting even if it is not completely what you wantbr br for a casual game or campaign there is a lot that dungeon world that is accessible inexperienced or nonhardcore gamers  there classes are fairly straightforward and focus on roles but there are options to do different things than the set menu offers eg a clerical spell casting paladin  on the surface this seems like a lot when building your character so long as it is offered  there are also a lot of choices you do not get to make  classes might have race options but if you want to play an elf paladin you are out of luckbr br magic is very barebones but it feel balanced  you always have the chance to lose a spell but likewise you have a better than even odds of keeping itbr br for a group of new gamers or a group that wants a more casual game dungeon world is adequate so long as their expectations from a game never evolve  i have my doubts someone would want to play a long campaign but even as a gamer with decades of experience i enjoy dungeon world particularly for one shots  show up roll dice and defy dangerparty engaged and able to participate

alien legion is a legendary comic whose vast story and perfect art especially by stroman is a series well worth reading by anyone who calls themselves a comic or scifi fan  it has been a while since we last had an alien legion story but uncivil war delivers though i would have liked a higher page count
well written but lack of western sources holds it back important parts of ottoman history are glanced over such as bayezid iis reigndespite lasting for  years selim the grims conquestswhich doubled the size of the empire in only a couple years receive only a scant four  pages nader shah the ottomans greatest enemy in the s is mentioned only once finally ottoman africa is only sparsely coveredbr overall its a good introduction but the being the enormous task it is of covering the entire history of the ottoman empire it does at times sag under its own weight
if you are looking for a fun entertaining military history of the ottoman empire look elsewhere this book is less concerned with the outcome of ottoman wars and more with exploring the process murpheys work is well researched with almost  pages of citations equal to about a quarter of the length of the reading material he also provides excellent maps and charts that you probably wont find elsewhere due to his use of original ottoman sources overall if its a great reference to have but only if youre already interested in the subject
this is a con you can only get it from amazoncom  when it arrived it had  positions in the rest is dialogue which although interesting to read not backed up with positions to use on the plate which would be the priority in a book for a vibration plate frankly an ego trip for the author
the book is exactly that i have expected

warning  spoilers  im quickly becoming a big sarah strohmeyer fan  while her books are somewhat predictable theyre still witty enough and well written enough to keep the entertainment highbr br kat is highly likable  as a main character  shes relatable shes quirky she stands up for herself  when faced with a crisis she fully admits to her own faults and immediately works to correct them to stand on her own two feet  when push comes to shove she even basically tells her boss to stuff it and walks outbr br the problem for me was griff  no matter how you look at it he was a jerk  he didnt trust his wife so rather than explain to her and give her a chance he opens secret accounts  if he truly wanted the best for his marriage he could have just said im opening this account with just my name on it due to your admitted spending problems  but worst of all he discusses his marital problems and his wifes shortcomings with his assistant  he puts his wife down and allows his assistant to constantly do the same thats not a good husband who respects his wife  at the end of the story i still wouldve left his sorry self behind rather than blow nine months worth of savings on him
great book for the improvement of your life and yourself

i enjoyed the book good history of physics and how science has evolved to change the laws of physics
read this as a kid so i bought it to read to my niece and nephew and they love it as much as i did
this book is one of the best studies of the calvinism vs arminianism debate ever written  wright shows why freewill theism is incompatible with the bible  freewill theism presupposes human autonomy whereas the bible presupposes god as sovereign over the universe he created  while dealing with serious subjects the book is wellwritten and intelligent readers will have little difficulty following wrights arguments i especially recommend this book to all bible college and seminary students
i really enjoyed this book it kept my attention and up some nights because i did not want to put it down the story is so well written that i felt i personally knew the characters if you like a good mystery this is the book for you
the runaways is my favorite series of comics and this collection is absolutely amazing it picked up right where my current collection of single volumes left off and everything in it was organized in a nice fashion i would recommend it to anyone looking to complete their collection of the runaways
the early chapters of spoils will appeal to anyone that enjoyed hbos rome but the story really takes off when andrikos is forced to flee his childhood home and enlist in the greek army  here the tone of the story changes almost reminding me more of early th century adventure stories like haggards allan quartermain or lord dunsanys jorkens stories  although spoils definitely has more of a hardboiled tone than these earlier tales  kachels research into the oft forgotten period following alexanders death is compelling and his descriptions of the periods military practices are an ongoing highlight throughout  pick it up you will enjoy it
case is gud bt the provided tempered glass is too small it does not cover the whole screen disappointing
superb book
very helpfuli am very pleased 
combining two of my favorite topics  knights and dinosaurs  into a fiction novel should have been the makings of a bestseller unfortunately it isnt and ever since i reached to halfway point in through the book i had the nagging suspicion that it wasnt going to get better it didnt and actually got much worse and it bugs me that the author wasted such a fantastic opportunitybr br the goodbr the concept is brilliant dinosaur backed knights the beginning of the book and initial battle scene were great english is of a pretty advanced level requiring actual reading skillsbr br the badbr it is very difficult to keep the characters apart as there are too many of them and they are often referred to by many different names titles and nicknames the same is true for locations kingdoms and so on having some maps or family charts probably would have helped this is even more true for the dinosaurs milan seems to have created his own naming conventions so dont expect to read about tyrannosaurs and velociraptors there is some of that instead the story is full of sackbuts carions montadors duckbills hookhorns and nosehorns and the reader is supposed to know what they are the only help are the small excerpts from the true book of names at the beginning of each chapter these even have a drawing of a dinosaur except it is not the dinosaur that is being described adding to more confusion it would really help if there was an alphabetical list with matching pictures to scale at the end of the bookbr br all of this really takes away the enjoyment that this book could have provided however the worst is the plot or the lack thereof through most of the book it actually looks like there is a plot until one starts to realize that there arent enough pages left to finish the book the end is one gigantic anticlimaxbr br i really wish someone would take this concept write a good book and then give the scriptto steven spielberg that would be a blockbuster for sure
bill oreilly does a wonderful job with his books and audiosi thought i ordered the book but got the audio my only problem with the audio is i seem to drive around the block too much to finish a certain part

the best book ever about egyptian mythology both small and big subjects are mentioned in this book everything a great book for people that absolutely love the egyptian mythology
this book is a thriller and  page turner that is hard to put down the characters were well developed interesting and perspective was brought to the horrors and brainwashing that led to the loss of humanity in the saracen    only skillful writing can bring that kind of conflict out in the reader  this book is well worth the reading please tell me this is not the last we hear from terry hayes and  the pilgrim 
great book i bought it for my husband but have already read it myself as it has wonderful wisdom for parents in general
very nice drum book with cd with itthanks
received a good copy of it this timethanks
the common core per se is obviously a good concept but lets call it parties creating the program for the common core are simply bad  it is all about continuation of controversial everyday math concept where students had to explain why  is reasonable sum of   school books should be written by good and experienced teachers and not by the fanatics  math can be understood by practicing and applying it to everyday life not by wasting time by reading poor and texty books like this one and  writing an assay on every equation the math teaching in the us is  in a big recession and sadly we will see consequences of that in the future we can see them already among poorly educated college students
written in a different manner it had a lot of focus on what was important to them not their records it is for someone that really wants to develop a balanced approach to history for some reason it was a bit painful to see these men not just as soldiers but people

this ya novel with the eyecatching book cover is a fastpaced actionpacked and emotionally stirring read from beginning to end we begin with an elaborate counterfeiting plot that involves teens and weaves itself throughout the story about a group of kids who take on a superhero role and decide to take action against bullyingbr br margo the lead character is a snobbish pretty girl who hangs around with the popular crowd things change for her when she becomes the victim of intense bullying these scenes stirred up in me such fierce motherly emotions i have a tween son and a teenager daughter and the thought that something like this could easily happen to them is scary it made me angry at what some kids do to other kidsbr br so of course i loved the whole concept of fighting against bullying and was surprised how a well a male author could portray female teen ways of thinking margo was well developed and she grew as a character she was tough yet vulnerable pretty yet ugly at the beginning when she displayed unsympathetic traits smart yet reckless she was a complex character that propelled the plot along i felt however that the other characters in the team of mob needed to be more fleshed out perhaps that is coming in the sequel since the ending alluded to thatbr br initially because of the many actionpacked scenes with a variety of characters that played very minor roles in the book i found myself trying to figure out who all these characters were and how they fit into the story halfway through i was totally invested and raced through the book the stakes were high and i wondered how things would be resolved the counterfeiting plot was interesting and it made me think how easily teens could get involved in crime without wanting to this was another form of bullying and the author succeeded in showing how hard it can be to get out of a tough situation i would have liked to have seen some parental involvement with at least one of the victims though the message needs to be clear that parents are their childrens best advocatesbr br although this book explores the veryreal topic of bullying because of the superhero element in the story the reader will need to suspend belief parents were scarce throughout the kids skipped school and never did homework or projects and police investigators dealt with serious criminal matters by involving teens without parental permissionbr br if you like the superhero complex i do i grew up watching wonder woman and spiderman then this book will appeal to you once the mob team was created and took action i could almost hear the matrix music in the background of my mind as they proceeded to fight bullying worldwide  i look forward to reading the sequel and seeing how the exciting mob will tackle not only bullying but their worldwide spreading famebr br note i would rate this book pg for scenes of underage drinking nightclubbing crime and suicideof the victims though the message needs to be clear that parents are their childrens best advocatesbr br although this book explores the veryreal topic of bullying because of the superhero element in the story the reader will need to suspend belief parents were scarce throughout the kids skipped school and never did homework or projects and police investigators dealt with serious criminal matters by involving teens without parental permissionbr br if you like the superhero complex i do i grew up watching wonder woman and spiderman then this book will appeal to you once the mob team was created and took action i could almost hear the matrix music in the background of my mind as they proceeded to fight bullying worldwide  i look forward to reading the sequel and seeing how the exciting mob will tackle not only bullying but their worldwide spreading famebr br note i would rate this book pg for scenes of underage drinking nightclubbing crime and suicide

i became acquainted with margie miklas on facebook  i followed her throughout her wonderful vacation to italy and greece this year   the photos she submitted were charming  i knew she had written several books about her travels one of which was released recently colors of naples and the amalfi coast  i was ecstatic when i received my copy  it is a beautiful hardback book that could be considered a coffee table book  inside the glossy pages have detailed descriptions associated with the pictures  she has such a passion for italy it exudes from her writings you feel almost like you are there  i especially love the way she shows how the city of naples is strikingly delightful  i have never considered visiting naples before until i saw the marvelous pictures and read about all the different sights to see and foods to enjoy  margie has piqued my curiosity and i will be considering a trip there in the not to distant future  her journey along the amalfi coast certainly brings all the beauty alive in her photos  the scenic little towns are so picturesque drenched in color with delightful houses that are just exquisite  this is without a doubt heaven on earth

this is a very touching story that adds still another dimension to the history of the nazi era  it goes more deeply into the trauma that was experienced by the children and grandchildren of the nazi monsters than even the very good documentary hitlers children  jennifer teeges grandfather was amon goeth one of the very worst of the concentration camp commandants as shown in the movie schindlers list  this book tells more about schindler as well  i read a german language version of this book  i would hope it is also available in english

item as described great value thx
does not qualify as transcendent high art the author uses various anecdotes to illustrate to the reader that yes the professional baseball season is long and unrelenting some insights into how the pros overcome slumps and capture the benefits of the high points but overall it just felt like i was being beaten over the head with the idea that hey this season is really long
the book covers a number of intrinsically difficult topics involving quite some mathbr in spite of the complexity of the matter the explanations are clear and apt even for a guy with no skills in math like mebr i recommend to get the free files with the exercise data it is an helpful tool to test your understandingbr i did not understand how to get the files and asked both the editor and the author thanks to both since they solved my issues quickly and effectively
i thought i was buying the book  this is a flimsy bit the trash that has no value  do buy it  it is not the book
great book for my certification but took  weeks to get
the esteemed bernard lewis a beacon of honesty in a dark world of modern profs who appease islam and bash the west at each turn is the foremost writer on middle east history for a reason though as a zionist i wish hed take a stronger stand on the islamic beheaders he is honest and explains why islam is still a th century caliphate religion a joke and why it never progressed after it was defeated by christianity centuries ago well done its time for the american left as dangerous arrogant and irrational as any enemy america has to wake up and stop siding with evil selfloathing is so unbecoming especially amongst my fellow jews
psychologically and spiritually thoughtprovoking this book is also quite simply inspiringjustice thomas brutally poor upbringing should be a source of pride for all americans especially blacks irrespective of your political leanings more than anything else the deep respect and gratitude that thomas has for his grandfather is evident throughout all  pages it seems his religiosity aided that mentality thomas minces no words in explaining he once feared the man who despite their differences when thomas was an angry black man at yale and holy cross
steele nails it so many times hereinas a former schoolteacher and someone who has dozens of leftwing selfloathing white friends of all ages who are full of guilt i wish theyd read even a portion of this wonderful book but theyre not exactly introspective or intellectually curiousthank goodness for folks like steele larry elder and thomas sowell hated by the biggest racists alive like jesse jackson and al sharpton for being honest and helping black societysteele uses great personal examples and anecdotes to show his growth out of the politically correct naive sheltered world of academia that we all left when we maturedone of the best books youll read so expect your sentient friends to do so and your arrogant friends to ignore you like mine have the world makes sense
although teddy roosevelt had an insatiable blood lust for hunting in the usa and africa he was able to recognize the need for conservation in both the animal world and in nature this book explores his role in the conservation of animal species and his establishment of national parks here and in puerto rico we owe him our gratitude for saving the american wilderness from developers and for protecting americas most beautiful and valuable assets which are still under threat from destruction in our modern age this book discusses the founding of many of todays well known nature societies ie sierra club national geographic just to name a sampling his need to hunt which is contrary to his conservation policy brought him into direct contact with wildlife and enabled him to understand the necessity and urgency to save and protect wildlife and wilderness this is not a book on politics it is a book about the preservation and protection of america it can be a tedious read on some pages but well worth sticking out the slow parts his place on mount rushmore is well deserved
this book was not what i expected but so much morewith the drug problem we are experiencing in the world today this novel opened my eyes as to how pervasive and devasting addictions are and how far reaching the effects spreadbeautifully written and the characters were so well developed as to come alive and stay with me long after i finished reading itlooking forward to reading his newest novel cutting for stone as this author is a master storyteller
this book tugged at my heart the family shares such warmth wit wh each othe  and therefore passes that on to youiwish the saga would never end
like all annie groves books it saws a delight to read very well written   accuracy i plan on reading all her books now good read
neal stephenson is a very fine author with talent to spare in many of the other reviews i read here people complained about his ending  well i will buy that however the read was worth it in fact i would have been  content had there been another  pages  that is how amazing this  mans writing is how interesting his characters are and how fascinating  the subject material he covers is it will be hell waiting another two  years for him to gift us with another book whether or not it relates to  the current release
hed write in this vein with similar rhythm and straightforwardness i am ashamed to say i can usually spot an authors tells and literary crutches within fifty pages or so
after reading wideacre i quickly purchased the second book of this trilogy  this was better than wideacre the characters were very well developed  interesting struggles between the roles of women during that time  be prepared to be disgusted at some of the events but it makes the book move quickly and at the end you will be so happy to know that there is still a book left to read in the trilogy
valerie i must admit youre winning me over i like this book its short and it doesnt go into unecessary detailswhich is what many writers and amazon reviewers do
very good characters and stories and exspecialy sherillyn kenyons story about stryder
this is a good book for a rainy day and nightit was very much like an old fairy tale story from the middle ages if you like those kinds of stories
i remain appreciative of martins skill but ive become exhausted with this series i kept going with a dance with dragons  even though i found myself skipping large descriptive portions that i found indulgent and pointless  because i really hoped there was finally going to be some significant plot progress by the end but theres not  pages and daenerys is still not even bound for westeros new potential kings are still cropping up we still dont know whats become of several starks the family we started this whole series with and whom have been steadily tortured and destroyed in every way possible with nary a sign of relief in sight it is just feeling so indulgent on martins part at this point i am losing faith that there will be a payoff i cant imagine what ending could possibly feel satisfying theres a chance he could still pull it off but i think hes just built anticipation too much and tortured us as readers too muchand yes he is still good at what he was always good at  creating a fully fleshedout world that at this point we know like its our own and portraying the points of view of a dizzying array of characters i dont think anything like it has ever been attempted and i appreciate that but enough already give us some beef
i really enjoyed this book although it was different than i was expecting based on the marketing blurbs i thought it would be more of a standard feelgood escapist chicklit novel where romance is front and center and the vintage clothing storyline is used as a fun backdrop instead this book has two quite serious and even tragic backstories  one for the main character phoebe and one for an elderly woman that she meets and befriends mrs bell both woman are seeking to understand and deal with guilt and pain from their past and although phoebe does have some love interests this isnt a happilyeverafter type story ultimately it is uplifting but in a more complex way and sorry for being vague i dont want to spoil the plotthe vintage clothing information and setting is superb phoebe opens a vintage clothing store after selling vintage for sothebys and we learn a lot about it through her which i mostly enjoyed if you are not into history or fashion at all though this book probably is not for you because part of the draw of vintage clothing for phoebe is the history implicit in each piece and this is used quite a bit in the story in her afterword the author lets us know that she herself is a huge vintage clothing fan and even includes an appendix with vintage clothing store listings for major cities around the worldalthough i really appreciated and enjoyed this book i cant quite give it  stars because there were times when i got a little bored with the vintage clothing detail and there were scenes and dialogue that felt contrived to me but otherwise this was a lovely and heartfelt read
  stars i actually finished this  weeks ago and have been sitting with it before reviewing as amongst all the uproar over the ending i needed to process it a little bit to figure out what i really think and what ive decided is this i am ok with the ending  its not my favorite but it does feel true to the individual characters and the overall storyline and theme of the trilogy while i appreciate when a series leaves me with emotional satisfaction this isnt the purpose of all books and an author owes us nothing roth did what she felt she needed to do   this is her work  and i respect that its thoughtprovoking and thats powerful in its own rightbut i still cant rate allegiant  stars because the larger problem for me with the book are the holes in the big reveal we get divergent and insurgent created an intriguing world for us with the faction structure creating a fascinating lens through which to comment on our own contemporary society  this is how the best dystopian fiction functions the problem with allegiant is that the big reveal  the story behind how this world was originally created  just has too many holes and leaves too many loose ends how is this genetic agency able to run so independently where is the rest of the government and everyone else how is it that no one has escaped from these experiments or has always been caught how do they have cameras all over the experiment capturing every moment and no one in the experiment ever becomes aware of this then there is the matter of the memorywipe and death serums and that there is one per faction  the serums are just way too convenient and feel contrivedcombine that with triss and fours love affair getting a bit annoying at times and allegiant just wasnt as satisfying as the first two books on its own it was only a   star for me but id still rate the entire series a star with many star ideas and scenes so i do look forward to the movies and hope they pull from the best
i have read the first  in this series in the last month and rated the st game of thrones  stars and the next two  stars each i am sorry to say i have to drop this volume to  stars for many of the same reasons others have done while martin continues to be a masterful writer and the characters and plot developments are intriguing the pace of progress has slowed to a crawl in this volume and for the first time martins decisions are starting to feel indulgent it feels like the characters and detail have become a burden a weight he is getting buried under rather than a pleasure to write or read i find myself skimming through descriptive paragraphs which i almost never do in order to get to the action thats a sign to me that things have gotten out of handthe brutality in these books still continues to irk me at times also especially all the rapesalso this book is kind of a split volume with number   it focuses on jamie cersei anya sansa samwell and some others and we hear virtually nothing of jon snow brandon tyrion daenerys and the others their perspective on these same events is apparently covered in book  i am not pleased that i will spend half of the next volume from what i understand learning their take and therefore there will be almost no plot developmenti am hoping it is all going to be worth it in the end and am trying to maintain faith in martin hopefully the next few books will get back to star statusthe potential is certainly there
i read a lot of authors categorized as chicklit but hadnt yet read marian keyes and gave this book a try based on an amazon suggestion and then the reviews i really liked the story and characters although was a little less enthusiastic about the voice of the book it centers on two girl friends and their male gay friend nearing  all from the same rural irish town but now living in london tara is in a bad long term relationship but afraid to leave it because she doesnt want to end up alone katherine has cut herself off from all relationships out of fear of being hurt and fintan has both a great career and relationship but faces potentially losing it all when diagnosed with a serious illness at first the last chance saloon of the title refers to taras belief that at her age she has to settle for whatever man she can get and her whining about this initially turned me off the book but once fintan is diagnosed everyone is forced to dig deeper and last chance becomes about living an authentic life not based in fear or conformity the backstory for how each character has become how they are is gradually revealed and they are forced to confront their choices and with the decision as to whether to continue as is or make big changes there is real depth and development for all of them over the course of the book and their friendship shines through  all somewhat rare in chicklit and something i appreciatedthe only thing holding me back from  stars for this one was the somewhat detached thirdperson voice it felt almost journalistic to me at times although it was funny in parts i didnt feel the warmth or humor that other reviewers seemed to it was just a bit distant feeling from my perspective but the story and characters were well developed  it is really just a subjective note about tone i think so if youre looking for a good chicklit book with some depth this is a good bet
im a big fan of wicked and liked son of a witch also but this one never quite captured my attention like they did it is partly that the two main characters  the cowardly lion and the oracle yackle are not the easiest characters to love and take awhile to warm up to i realize this is part of the point of the book to the extent there is a point  the unpacking of the histories that made them what they are  but it still didnt quite work for me as a readeri think the fact that much of the book is relayed through their memories as part of the lion interviewing yackle also added to this sense of distance and never quite let the story catch on again on one level this can be seen as a kind of commentary on history and memory itself as maguires books most certainly are but in this case it just didnt quite work i felt the ending was also completely unsatisfying in my viewon the other hand the magic quirkiness and intrigue of maguires oz are still present here if you love that from his other books than that may be enough for you
although quotmystic riverquot lacks some of the intensity of the patrick kenzieangie gennaro series i was thoroughly involved in this novel  dennis lehane is the consummate storyteller and quotmystic riverquot definitely lives up to lehanes fine standard  about halfway through the book i could see where it was leading but yet i was tornwhile i wanted to reach its conclusion to see my suspicions confirmed half the fun is getting there and i hated for this book to end  thanks dennis for another winner
cute book  ive always loved this story  pages arent necessarily exciting but its the story that counts
this story has been a favorite of mine for many years  i then noticed reviews comparing this book to another book the blue castle by lm montgomery  and intimating that colleen mccullough had plagiarized this book  i find it hard to believe that this credentialed author would need to plagiarize anyones work but i did buy and read the blue castle to compare  other than a similar main theme of a woman who is destined to live life as a spinster due to her lack of presence and finances i found the books to be incredibly dissimilar  i also think that the ladies of missalonghi is a far superior book for a number of reasons  colleen mccullough weaves many more themes through the story including a mystery a love story a shocking change of heart a bit of the paranormal  and most importantly there a number of characters who experience growth with redemption as the story progressesthere is little of this in the blue castle which is dogmatic preachy and dull including surly characters who never grow or change  i managed to get through the book for one reading but ive permanently removed it from my kindle as i would never choose to read it again  on the other hand i read ladies every year or two because it is so heartwarming  at one point the mystery man in the neighborhood asks missy why she wants to marry him and she says simply because i have nothing to lose  that single sentence expresses all the grief and desperate existence of women of that era who did not have beauty or money to bring to the marriage game and were destined to live a lonely loveless lifeladies of missalonghi is not a copy of the blue castle by any stretch  the main theme is one that exists in many books
it seems like so many of the books ive picked up in  start with a fresh concept and then proceed to go nowhere with it  unfortunately this is one of thempros take this imp from the ninth level of hell the ubiquitous mr b and trap him in the physical form of a book that you are reading  hell tell you a meandering tale while simultaneously coercing and threatening you so that youll burn it  this is a great concept and if there was a reason why this imp was here that was of great importance or if burning the book might do something fantastic it would work with the any plot you can imagine thin or otherwise  these are the big idea stories clive barker normally makes a great novel out of  books of blood comes to mindcons  unfortunately there isnt a real reason the imp is in the book  he just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time  burning the book wont do much except maybe free him and from his own narrative it seems he didnt do much in the world of men  even his incidental romances and difficulties dont seem to go anywhere  little is explained and this poor player struts his hour on the stage without any mind as to what is going on  his insights are painfully obvious so dont even need to be mentioned  and then you have to suffer through several pages of prosthelytizing about bookburning with no justification  its bizarrely empty of gravitysummary  skip it  seriously
the story is very interesting  maria has some humorous family history here especially when she is talking about herself learning to speak english  i enjoyed the book very much although there were a couple of places that seemed a little longwinded but skimming works well there  i really liked their devotion to the family as a whole and their religion very outstanding  
this second book takes us into the life of liir the boy who may or may not be the son of elphaba the wicked witch of the west this tale takes a while to unfold with the reader thinking when will liir figure things out im glad the ending seemed to answer some questions
many of us have dreamt about writing a hit song right  how many actually have  yip i too have tried my hand at penning song lyrics but found out that theres much more to it than writing a few rhyming lines  twotime oscar winner the morning after from the poseidon adventure and we may never love like this again from the towering inferno joel hirschhorn
this is a truly precious book it is best example since to kill a mockingbird of an important literary novel that is a heartstopping pageturner the poisonwood bible delivers the most intriguing
im tragically sad and like another reviewer once said i may never be happy ever again even though im tragically sad
much of the science in this book is questionable  unfortunately there is also some good useful information in the book so the uninformed reader will have a difficult time separating the wheat from the chafe  but please realize that sugar containing foods do not cause a cellular inflammation throughout the body also the supplementation appears to be oriented towards doing no harm  that is good but much of it will not help either  unfortunately this book appears to appeal to the desperate who are looking for the magic bullet any magic bullet other than good nutrition  also almost any book or doctor or health conscious person can tell you that drinking a large volume of water every day will do wonders for your complexion and skin  eating a healthy diet on top of that will be even better  the use of supplements in addition probably does little or nothing
frankly after about  pages i found this book boring  i am not sure exactly why but it doesnt have the impact on me that the author intended  i believe the main reason is that although the author makes many legitimate points he cannot resist putting just enough of a twist on some of his information so that some of the truth is lost  this tends to negate his impact on me
this is a magical book when anyone i know has a child i buy them this book to give to their child when they begin to read books it is quite simply a must in any childs book collection  i still have my childhood copy on the self and at times when i really need a smile ill pull it down off the shelf and read it and it never cease to give me a lift  i recommend this book as highly as any i have ever read it really is the benchmark for childrens books
this was just okay it was not my favorite p gregory book by far but it was an enjoyable enough read
this has become my favorite volume of fairy tales ever produced while the brothers grimm ellen datlow and even disney have all made gallant attempts at telling these classic morality stories no one can hold a candle to james finn garners brilliant masterpiecethe fairytales presented in this volume include little red riding hood the emperors new clothes the three little pigs rumplestiltskin the three codependent goats gruff rapunzel cinderella goldilocks snow white chicken little the frog prince jack and the beanstalk and the pied piper of hamlinwhile all the stories are wonderful cinderella and the frog prince stand out and are my favorites read these two firstwhile these stories are great if you just curl up and read them by yourself theyre even better when read aloud with a big group of your friends but whatever you do dont read these right before bedtime as the title suggests youll be laughing to hard to ever get to sleepthese stories are suitable for children but even more fun for adults this book gets my highest recommendations
when i first started reading this book i wasnt sure if i was going to like it but by the end of it i had really enjoyed it  it is about a girl who was quite a partier but didnt consider it a problem until she ended up in a rehab centre called the cloisters  it takes place in new york and ireland in the s  by the end of it i felt like we all could probably benefit from a little psychoanalysis  i would recommend this as a good read
this book is a departure from the formula of his previous works like clear and present danger and patriot games  it is a story of revenge taken by clancys cia operative john clark  we see how clark came to be who he is  in the jack ryan novels  this book was fantastic and it is recomended to  all as are all of clancys novels
this book is structured in short two to three page chapters that are engaging and practically will you to turn the page  i think this is the first alex cross i enjoyed the characters and settings their were some great twists and turns  james patterson writes some of the fastest moving thriller novels out there
i dont know how to express in words how unbelievably amazing this novel is just please go out and read it
mr north broke the law violated his oath as an officer and dishonored the marine corps  because of a technicality he walkedrather than serve a considerable sentence at the us disciplinary barracks ft leavenworth and then being subjected to the public humiliation of being drummed out of the corps before assembled marines and dishonorably discharged much of what is wrong with corporate america was exemplified by mr norths behavior  shame on all who look up to mr north as a hero  he isnt
im not going to give the ending away but i was very surprised  i certainly hope that our country or world for that matter will never come down to genetic testing and categorizing  chicago was the main headquarters for all the genetic testing etc  and anyone who did not possess the correct genes were considered gdsgenetically damaged  tobias and beatrice are still trying to save their world and its only going from bad to worse as they encounter more and more bad people  i would recommend this series to anyone who likes scifi with a wee bit of romance a lot of blood and guts and killings  it was definitely worth the money
wheres the fire  wheres the passion  wheres the romance  why are these two the main characters  they are boring boring boring  and unlike some of lindseys other books theres no spark  she should have focused on rafe or even ophelia they probably would have made a more interesting book
this book is dull so dull i didnt even finish it  so dull i cant even must the emotion to hate or even dislike it  the writing is fine but the characters    just so boring  lucy is occasionally funny but gregory is dull as dirt  the only character i found interesting was lucys actual intended and his relationship with his father too bad hes    gay or something  so i guess hell never get his own book or at least not as a mainstream romanceits just disappointing to read something so dull from an otherwise usually funny and entertaining author
president mobutu former president dictator of the republic of congo formerly zaire was the prototype african dictator albeit without the bloodlust of other famous african dictators squandering the natural resources of a rich and fertile country and pillaging the countrys revenues for his own ends  in the footsteps of mr kurtz ismichala wrongs a journalist who has spent a lot of time in africa account of mobotus congo what happened to the country and its futurewrong meets several of zaires citizens ranging from disabled merchants in kinshasa to european farmers and relates their stories through vivid written portraits and the impact of mobotus legacy of greed and corruption on their lives  time and time again i was astounded at the stupidity and greed of the vast excesses of the man and his cronies  although he constantly changed ministers usually once or twice a year such was the mindset of the replacements that they would immediately set out and pillage what they could while they could  vehicles properties office furniture quickly disappeared with each new minister  it is a marvel that he managed to stay in power for as long as he did but as wrong discovers mobutu did have a lot of charisma in his day  and managed to starve off a number of attempts to wrest power from him  his family cronies and zaires bank accounts were key to that  just the same as joseph conrads key character mr kurtz in the heart of darkness mobutu once an idealistic leader was corrupted by the dark heart of africabut it was not just mobutu to blame for the state of the country wrong points a finger at the western governments who continued to bankroll the president at a time when communist and western governments were seeking influence in africa  mobutu superbly playing the western and communist governments against each other in attempt to get as much money out of them as possible  the us won the day and continued to pour money into the country knowing that mobutu was skimming it  but with the fall of the communist states the funds dried up and mobutu pillaged his own country even further leaving his own people to face the burden for his excesses and vanity projects  wrong visits mobutus old palace retreat and discusses the fittings and finishings of the palace which has fallen in shambles after it was looted when his government fell  another of the vanity projects a nuclear reactor is in a dangerously run down state and may well provoke a nuclear crisis in the countryhowever i note the recent g summit junejuly  made inroads into the consideration of writing off debt to impoverished countries of the world  but congo probably wont benefit until the congolese government makes changes  although mobutu is long gone the government which overthrew him is little better at helping its people  the future appears to be bleak for the millions of the congoin the footsteps of mr kurtz is a readable account of the excesses of a single man and the impact it had on his country  this is recommended reading if you are interested in modern and colonial africa
although i love the series i have to say that a dance with dragons was a well written story with a major content problem to be fair the book had some highs and i was thinking yes finally the story is getting good but then i was massively disappointed the book has a confusing and unpleasantly startling conclusion that leaves me wanting more but dreading the end of the story i still am in love with the series and i think martin is a brilliant writer but i just need to have faith that he will finish the story with the same awe inspiring brilliance that he started it with
among his many excellent books travels is one of best and most gripping as the autobiography of one of the most celebrated writers of our time this book does not disappoint the fascinating life of michael crichton is painted by this master story teller as a gripping tale of adventure mental angst and spiritual development everything from attending medical school to almost drowning while scuba diving is covered in this thoroughly engrossing book crichton describes his lifes journeys in a very almost brutally honest way this book apart from being a great read lets you get inside crichtons mind and discover where all of his amazing tales originated
i bought this as a baby shower gift for a little owen loved the fact that it not only has his name but is adorable and great family story the mom was thrilled
odd gets better by the book  in this episode odd encounters evil greater than ever before but he learns that he is not alonenuf said  dont miss this great story
i read this book quickly and laughed out loud while reading it  the author writes wellthe characters are described as real personalities it reminded me of quotthe world according to garpquot
read this as a kid and absolutely loved it  great read for kids and adults  i plan on reading this to my kids
in  elizabeth short traveled to hollywood to become famous and see her name up in lights instead the darkhaired beauty became immortalized in the headlines as the black dahlia
this book was recommended by someone in our company known for going on forever on his theories of how teams work  i found the book as windy as he is  i decided it was not worth the effort to finish this was a case where someone took a pamphlets worth of material and inflated it to book size  dont bother
there is an awful lot of hype surrounding this novel and i hope that nothing bad happens to it  it is a sweet book and id hate for all the big bad cynics out there to get a chance to stomp all over it  alexs english is funny because it is comprehensible without being accurate  is that a funny joke for the whole time  maybe not but the conceit is clever and works for the novel  foers work requires a sort of patience from the reader  after all hes telling you with the title that he will eventually come to what he considers the payoff so just wait for itit is a backwards bildungsroman about a young man traveling to the east and metaphorically to the previous century to find out who saved his grandfather and thereby how he himself was allowed to live  he is guided by alex who speaks a twisted english that befits his propensity for some fraction less than halftruths and his quotblindquot grandfather the driver  now come on just reading that you have to admit is funnythis book could have been run through the meticulous edits that would have polished it to a fine lustre but so many strange bits would have been buffed away that it could not have been worth itso youre still curious about the novel after everything alse youve read  click away and have it sent so that you too will giggle while explaining the dogs name to your friends
if you have read and have enjoyed the first two books do yourself a tremendous favor and do not read this one imagine your own ending maybe write some fan fiction and actually put your imagined ending on paper and then share it with your friends and save them the anguish of reading this book too whatever you choose will undoubtedly be better than this ridiculous poorly executed excuse for a series finale spoiler aheadroth had a great opportunity here several of them really but i will spare you the details of how many different plot line choices she could have made even those that still included turning our hero into a raging pansycake
who would ever have guessed i wont say much more because it will give some of the gist of the story away but well worth the read
i have been reading a lot of rachel gibson lately and i think this is one of her best hot sexy and romantic good characters excellent beachpool reading
this was a book i bought when i was curious about bdsm it was both entertaining and educational i would reccomend it
i read the book first and then saw the movie the book goes into greater detail and extends beyond where the movie leaves off the movie and book were just okay if you can get the book from the library and the movie on hbo or elsewhere theyre worth spending a little time both are like fast food youll still feel hungry after consuming it
i have a weak spot for teen vampire romance as a bit of an outsider myself and as a quietly gothic person i completely get teenagers fascination with vampires its a chaotic phase of life and you feel like youre on the outside of things looking in and vampire stories help kids embrace this and this book certainly fits that well sixteen year old raven madison is a wonderfully snarky kindergothen ie a teenaged goth who isnt afraid to think for herself and stand up to the golden boys and girls who clutter dullsville high and try to get in her way as she finds out the identity of the mysterious family thats moved into the creaky old mansion in town the tone and the writing are a bit flippant and a little silly at times but its pitchperfect for this character and her feelings about her world as she manuevers to find her place in it
good read would like more from the series can not wait for the next book to come out from the  author
this book had potential in the beginning but fell flat i just couldnt connect with the characters and the author didnt write in the tradition of historical lettering and writing  i did finish it but it took me much longer for i kept falling asleep and losing my place i wont be purchasing the others in the series
this novella set in th century peru is all of  pages not including the acknowledgements foreword afterword and about the author which in and of themselves are well worth reading i skipped through this book rather quickly and was absorbed in the removed tone and style of the writing anyone who is deeply involved in literature will easily distinguish the reason for it having won the pulitzeran exceptionally well written book cunningly poses a question that slowly weaves its way through the plot more can not be said without setting forth spoilers so i leave you with this the business of literature is not to answer questions but to state them fairly anton pavlovich chekhov 
this is book  in a tril and should e read in order this was a good read even tho it seemed a little slow in some spots to me it left me with a dark dangerous and edgy feeling that at first had me a little worried but i soon got over it because i knew there was a next book coming
i loved the story and couldnt put it down at timesi just wish the chapters had time and place headings i found the story jumped around a lot especially in time and it often took me a few paragraphs to work out where the story was at
after reading the first chapter i decided to move to page  and start after cromwell grew up hoping that the narative would be more straightforward unfortunately i was still struggling with who was speaking to whom i finally decided to assume that the speaker was always talking to cromwell even though the author did not identify it as suchi finally gave up reading the book and jumped on amazon to see what others had to say nice to know that i wasnt the only one who could not figure out what was going on it was like walking into a private conversation that was already in process and trying to understand what the people were discussing why would an author with so much knowledge of the period and such an interesting period at that use a confusing storytelling method and why didnt the editors suggest something differentso thanks to everyone who helped me understand that the confusion was not just me
i always wondered what happen to the family  now i know and appreciate their music that much more thank god
tbh is my favorite book of all time and i loved reading more about tatiana and alexander you see these characters develop oceans apart tatiana now living in the usa begins to doubt what happened when she left russia and wonders if alexander is still alive afterall she becomes obsessed with looking for clues to what really happened and knows she cannot move on until she uncovers the truth alexander struggles with inner demons and the emotionalphysical torture in russian prison camps and the red army the romantic tension between the two that was so powerful throughout the first novel isnt as apparent in this one because they are apart but it is just as riveting talk about dimensional charactersthis author is amazing the last  pages are so intense that i raced through them at lightening speed a must read if you loved the bronze horseman
i watched the acclaimed and award winning documentary restrepo and held on for dear life from start to finish perhaps the most realistic afaik and gripping tale of an active warzone as i have encountered the scene in the movie where the roadside bomb blows up the humvee the producers are riding in is perhaps the most physically jarring thing ive ever seen in any movie
i love jacquie dalessandros books and ever since the first one i read i got hooked on it  this particular book was just ok to me  i felt that i didnt quite connect with catherine ashfield and felt that andrew was too good for herthe plot itself was interesting and it was a little unexpected towards the end when solving the mystery  i would still highly recommend msdalessandros books
i am an avid elmore leonard fan  while this book is dated the basic premise of the story had all the traditional earmarks of a leonard novelonce the book begins hitting the climax the book takes a totally different direction the main storyline is abortedi was listening to an unabridged audio version of this book  i returned the book to amazon since i thought i had an incomplete book  the book ended on the th tape with no warning that it was complete  a sixth tape was added which started with an elmore leonard short story that was included in a previous bookdont waste your time with this book
dick francis brings in a different kind of hero an accountantthe story is very enjoyable  this novel differs from some of his others in that the hero actually has a sex lifewhile i would highly recommend this book francis does throw out a number of easy clues to figure out the true villian in the story
the first half of the book is robinsons best effort ever  this is true in light of everything that happened in the world after this book was publishednot being a military person a lot of the descriptions regarding equipment was lost on me  that was not really a problem since it did not detract from the plot or charactersi believe the ending of the book came to fast and was not well thought out  i do not believe any president would give that type of orderthis book was far better than the shark mutiny
it is very informantive well worth buying the sev was fast  exllent qulitay amazoncom is the best  robert f schramm
this beautifully written gem of a book is a spiritual treasure trove for those who dont especially warm to pop cultures view of angelshere we have an almost cliched spinster lady yes the word certainly applies to her miss garnet who has lost her longtime companion not romantic and uncharacteristically decides to take a pension in venice for  months so she lets out her own house and off she goesto a voyage of discovery that is at once so subtle and yet so beautiful that it is a pleasure to readis there an angel watching over our heroine or is it just a longawakened spirituality within her how does one account for this longdenied longoverdue blossoming of the inner flower that is miss garnet it sounds so pat but it is just the oppositeand the story within the story an ancient hebrew text is just as fascinating as the story itselfthis is simply a magnificent book highly recommended
cathy kelly is someone i had never read before and im anxious to see what else she has written she started with a funny and selfdeprecating dedication to all the people who kept her going and helped her to keep on track in finishing the book and you would never know it because it held my complete interest for well over  pagesthe story of a modern irish family of three grown women and their parents just between us is as contemporary as it is heartwarming rose and hugh miller are about to celebrate their th anniversary rose is still lovely and a pillar of her circle charity work gracious parties committee attendance and all the rest affable hugh welloff and from an old monied family is equally charming but is something wrong beneath the surfacedaughter stella is divorced with one winsome daughter amelia a successful attorney stella shuns all men preferring to give her daughter a stable life instead but stella is young and beautifulcan this last middle daughter tara is a writer on one of irelands most successful soap operas she is madly in love with her husband finn whom she married after only  months of courtship now she is learning things about finn that could tear them apart youngest daughter holly sees herself as fat and unattractive not realizing her beauty and appeal a sweet funny and smart woman she lives in a flat with two fun friends funky designer and gay fashionista right across the hall they cook hang out and confide until a handsome male stranger moves into the flat one floor abovetold with compassion humor and a bit of sass just between us is a great book to read on a weekend day when its too cold outside to rake the leaves yes it has a happy ending and no i wont apologize for loving the heck out of ithighly recommended
the summer i was  between junior high and high school my mother recommended that i read this book of course i wasnt going to listen to herso i pouted around for a few days and then one evening afraid i was going to succumb to utter boredom i picked it upfor the next week i did nothing but read gone with the wind i read it every waking moment far into the night first thing in the morning i remember having a perpetual headache from eyestrain i simply could not stop until the last page when i burst into tears and sobbed for what seemed like hoursthe book has much the same effect on me now every few years i read it cover to cover even though i can quote key passages by heart by this time so let me tell you a little bit about gone with the wind the first thing being that it is not what you think it is its hard to compete with david oselznick here even though hes dead but i beg you to put the movie aside and prepare yourself for sheer satisfying bosomheaving pleasure this was a thoroughly amazing book in the thirties and it wears well it is much more than the story of spoiled willful scarlet ohara and her deadly flirtations scarlet may have been the first feminist women in her day had no power whatsoever their entire lives were decided by convention whom they should marry what they should eat where they should live what they should wear but scarlet would have none of it and the only way she could break free of convention was to use her wiles to flaunt it she didand it worked she was and is my hero selfish and vain as she wason quite another level this is the heartbreaking story of the war between the states from the southern point of view as a teen who was raised in california i had no clue about how the south felt about the war and no way to find out this book silly as some may find it taught me that there are two sides to any conflict two equally powerful and opposing points of view that are tragically at odds sound familiar not much different than the middle east todaynow a word about the books purported racism yes there are slaves in this book and i am not going to presume to tell you not to resent or be angry about that fact but considering the time in which she lived i think that margaret mitchell tried to deal with the issue of slavery as best she could the slaves in the book are not the simpering fools of the movie they are portrayed with as much dignity as i think mitchell could manage when considering that there was no way she could condone or ignore that slavery was a fact during the civil war mammy is not a caricature in the book prissy is a much more sympathetic young woman and the other slaves are portrayed as thinking feeling human beingsthe emancipation is not regretted and is seen from the freed slaves point of view as much as possible that having been said i am not advocating this book as something it is not it is not an abolitionist work and it is not antislavery per se it is not anything more than phenomenally wellwritten story with a lot of truly interesting historical information about the s and beyondgone with the wind is the story of a lifetime not the caliber of war and peace but for its time incredibly good reading summer is almost upon us this is a perfect time to sit under a magnolia tree with a mint julep and treat yourself to an oldfashioned story youll never forget
not as good as quotsushi for beginnersquot quotangelsquot is nevertheless a fast and fun read even for this reviewer who makes it a point never to read quothollywood novelsquotkeyes bubbly irish humor and her loveable characters translate to la la land without a hitch and the adventures of newly separated maggie walsh and her best friend emily now a scriptwriter in la are hilarious maggie has her irish eyes opened wide by the antics in los angeles which include everything from eyebrow waxing a procedure she is painfully forced to submit to to bleaching unmentionable parts of the posteriorwhat maggie really wants deep inside is her husband back but she doesnt quite realize thatas she sorts through her hurt feelings and the story of her marriage we know it before she does along the way there are some eyeopening experiences and not just with her eyebrowsthis is just a fun booknot memorable but very enjoyable indeed and very good for someone who is in between heavy reads and just wants an enjoyable piece of wellwritten fluff
on the surface the last chance saloon has all of the elements of a classic marian keyes novel delightful irishborn friends transplanted to london their hilarious thirtysomething adventures their wonderful bonhomie and the sheer loveable nature of just about every character in the story there always has to be one bad guyand this one
like marian keyes other books quotwatermelonquot her first is warm witty in the extreme funny and somehow wise all at the same timethe book begins on a horrifying happenstance claire has just given birth to a beautiful healthy daughter and as she lies basking in the afterglow her slime of a husband james enters her hospital room to tell her that  he is in love with another woman and that  he is therefore leaving claire just like that no muss no fuss with a beginning like that its hard to imagine where to go from here but keyes manages to pick claire up by the scruff of her neck shake her off and move her and her newborn back to dublin from london where she had been living with jamesonce in dublin claire runs the gamut of emotions from not showering for a week to crying nonstop for  hours to yelling and screaming to becoming the quotantichristquot to her large extended and very strange family yet we love her more on every page and we want so much for claire to quotsort herself outquot as the brits saywill claire sort herself out will james come back and grovel if he does will claire take him back will her parents ever break free of their strange and abominable daughters its all answered in the book in prose that is so completely fresh and witty so very funny that the reader almost forgets that there is actually a real story here and a good one at thatits nice to know that keyes only got better with time because this her first novel is just about perfect and im glad to know that it wasnt a flash in the pan
on the surface quotlucy sullivan is getting marriedquot has all the aspects of keyes usual hilarious and rollicking novels thirtysomething brits making their way through the perils of london life from deadboring jobs to broken relationships to the perpetual search for true lovebut beneath the hilarity is another story entirely the devastating effects of alcoholism on families relationships and the psyche only keyes could take such a serious subject and write about it with such love and real humor but it is there nevertheless so if one is looking for a mindless romp this is not the booklike all her main characters keyes lucy sullivan is loveable through and through and the reader follows lucys perpetual escapades with all the wrong men with wringing hands why go for the alcoholic drugsodden user the admittedly gorgeous gus when there is a man in the wings who really wants her and is entirely suitable will lucy ever see what we see will she allow herself to stopped being used and start being happyread it and seeand prepare to be enchanted

i put off reading this book for a long time as i got so sick of waiting for grrm to crank any work out when i finally broke down and bought this i was reminded why i thought he was such a great author in the first place i still sadly think he wont live to finish the series but its been a great ride so far
fun and fast read  this is not your normal fantasy  if youre looking for something different look no further p

fred marcellino did the world a huge favor before he left it by updating and thus saving this fun and simple story with beautiful images and removing all of the usual hurtful and ugly ones and restoring the book to its proper setting
so far this is probably my least favorite book in the series however i still enjoyed it immensely i felt like certain sections were dragging along but it wrapped up wonderfully in the end
when first written this book was the most comprehensive and enlightening treatment on the genesis of the hatred within the middle east what was written then is still true or only more so today highly recommend for anyone trying to understand why the region still ticks like a bomb
the book arrived in time so shipping was fine but the spine was broke which was no jokelucky i know a temporary repair so were good therei just wish the seller had put in a description of the books condition so i could have made a better purchasing choice
the title was the best part of this book  not worth purchasing  if you must read it check it out from the library or borrow it dont ask me for it  mine is headed for goodwill because i can not stand to burn or trash a book it was awful and vulgar  very disappointed i hope someone else writes the book to fit the title  unfortunately i bought two books by the author and was disappointed with both

this book was the truth and while im a both of both frazier and ali i understood where frazier felt and where he was coming from  his story was growing up hard and battling for everything talk about a sport that is lost in these days and times boxing aint nothing like it use to besame with so many other things but boxing back in the day was poetry and full of bumps and glory joe frazier was one of boxings greatest poets and he truly created his own canvas and left a lasting impression  this book pulls no punches and it  is very direct and to the point  you feel a man who wanted to put the past behind him but also to clear the air and tell it like it is and was  smokin joe was  cool with it and was about characterthe man was the truth in and out of the ring and he sets the record straight in this must read book  rip

jackie robinson  was not only a great athlete but also a great leader who is a ground breaker and this book not only  speaks on his great accomplishements within the game of baseball but also a civil rights  leader and he was a leader and personally jackie robinson should have a national holiday in his honor  because he fought for a job and earned it we are only  years removed from the time he broke the color line in major league baseball  this book  goes into details about his friendships and the people he encountered a real whose who of movers and shakers  i love the title of this book because it is so true especially for a black man in america a title that speaks the truth then and now however jackie robinson to me is required  reading for everybody and the true meaning of the struggle
george fraser has written a book about the importance of networking and finding your footing and how to be successful and be effective i feel this book is a great compliment and very moving to whatever goals sought out and reached very vaulable book for the business world and beyond
im a block fan from keller random walk and a myriad of short stories rather than his serial mysteries so perhaps my expectations werent that of other block fans  i gave this book a chance because i enjoy his writing and i dont have time for any more series books right nowthis book was wonderful the characters were developed and interesting and the story was an unusual way to show that peoples lives are interconnected in ways you wouldnt imagine to ends that can surprise  i will agree with some that the sex was a bit over the top but it was necessary for the development of susans character and to place the right people in the right places to convey information from one place to another eventually leading to the climax of the story  that is the point of the story and along the way we had the pleasure of a voyeuristic view into the minds bodies and souls of some extremely interesting human beings  it was a story of peoples lives woven together during an emotional time in new york city  in life not everyone lives the same way and its interesting that while people have no trouble reading about a killer planning and executing a murder or murders reading about explicit sex causes embarassment and annoyancewhen i finished listening to this unabridged audiobook i was almost exhausted from the intensity of it  it was one of those books that caused me to stop and think about it for even days after i was done and to want to talk about it and share it with others because of how good it really is  i highly recommend this book but be warned  it is intense there are unusual sexual ingredients there is sadness happiness pain  love  it is a powerful novel that you wont soon forget after you read it
for romance novel fans this book has it all engaging lead characters interesting secondary characters humor and enough of an entertaining plot to keep you reading this was one of the more entertaining romance novels ive read in a while and one of the few times i didnt find myself wanting to smack the heroine upside the head for being so silly
enjoyable book not topnotch gaiman the final denouement was kinda predictable but satisfying nonetheless some of the meanderings with the gods through their adventures grew tedious i wanted to shoot them all at several points pleased i made the effort to see it through though
my kids go nuts for the little critter books this one is ok not my favorite but the kids still loved it
okay if you have not read the first two book in this series start there with divergent and read no further in this review if you are looking to as to how the book is before you buy it  yes read it i will let you know right up front that this book was an emotional zipline that you must ride to sum it up in the only way i can is this  veronica roth has balls of cold hard steel my hat is off to her bravo spoiler alert  you have been warned dear ms rothi would like to personally say thank you for keeping it real and having the cojones to do what you felt was needed to keep the story true to itself i have no doubt that you knew good and well people were going to react in a not so favorable way and yet you still remained true to the story and i can not express how upsettingly awesome it was to read i cried
spoiler alert  but from all the negative review you may have already made some relatively accurate guesses  of course i would have loved a happier ending but i also loved this ending  the protagonist in this story was a wwjd kind of person throughout the series  unlike jesus she battled human character flaws and consistently ended up doing the right thing  i believe veronica roth chose the most appropriate and compelling way to end the series  she gave us a very good example of true love and forgiveness for your fellow man  i was in tears for most of the last ten percent of the book and they were tears of appreciation for the sacrifice that was made a lot like jesus  admission i also cried at the end of son of god even though i already knew the ending  in the same way that tobias suffered with his loss i think its ok to suffer the pain of loss of a wonderful character in a book  thank you veronica roth for making me experience so much emotion and leaving me with a memory that will stay with me much longer than most books ive read
for those of us who live sheltered lives insulated from evil and those who would prey on innocence  we are truly blessed  this book was an eye opener and i am so grateful that i read it  while it was not an easy read it was a compelling one  i could not stop reading until i could confirm that these sweet young children were safe  i cried for those children who didnt make it out  what an amazing and hear wrenching read
there is not much that this author writes that id consider in the least boring but half way through i lost focus on this book so i found myself skipping around  i did the awful thing of reading the end of the book and actually found that i liked the end better than any other bit
look phil is an annoying guy and some of that comes across in this book but phil is a great tournament poker player and that also comes across and the reason i bought this book was to get an insight into how phil plays and why he plays that way and to maybe find things i could use myself in the two months since ive finished the book ive tinkered with using different strategies phil suggests with good success and on top of anything else i have now finished st in a  player tournament and th in a  player tournament at luxors and th in a  player tournament at an online site i honestly feel that my tournament play has gotten a lot stronger and im still improving thanks in large part to things i either read in this book or things that this book made me think about
the lives of christopher chant is humour at its very best wynne jones is one of the best childrens fantasy writers she pioneered techniques still being used today this is one of three books witch week and charmed life  and gives us an understanding of the person behing the lofty and mysterious  chrestomanci its a very funny and tongue in cheek look at christopher  chants childhood as he walks between quotanywheresquot and gets  caught up in illegal activities unknowingly wynne jones puts plenty of  laughs into it from christopher reading the unabridged arabian nights to  the interesting goddess who freezes christopher in a wall until he agrees  to her demandsand all the while christopher is losing lives
rd and final book in the series i read a lot of reviews that didnt like book and i was hesitant to buy it but curiosity got the best of me and i had to find out how it ended  i was happy i bought it it was a much slower pace than the first two and the ending was different than i would have liked but overall i liked the book and glad it closed out the series without leaving you hanging
this is one of a raft of books that my wife and i got to prepare for potty training our daughter  it is a flipup story book that allows the child to interact with the story and also serves to make him or her comfortable with the concept in general  the story follows different animals and asks the question wheres the poop ending with a child on a potty thereby demonstrating where little girls and boys poop goes  its really quite clever and works well as part of a general familiarity campaign with the whole concepthonestly i struggled deciding whether to give this three or four stars  it is fun and clever and my daughter liked it at first but she tired of it fairly quickly  unlike other books there isnt much story to it you find the poop for each animal and you move on to the next one and thats it  unlike stories which my daughter never seems to tire of this one didnt seem to hold her interest over time  was the book useful  yes i think it was and i do like that it is interactive allowing the child to see for him or herself where the poop is  as an instruction aid however i think it is limited as there is not enough narrative to hold the childs interest nor to explain the critical features that make up the whole potty training sequence as some other books do very well  for both child and parentin the end pun not intended i do not regret getting this book but it is probably one that i could have done without if i were to do this over  it is good but not necessary in my opinion  every child is different however and i ultimately rated it three stars based on my childs reaction to it  unlike some other books that combine a story for the child along with excellent reference and instruction material for the parents this one is solely for the child
great book with lots of good information that does not get discussed in the regular discourse of the civil rights movement
i bought and read this book when it came out and have just read it again  five years later  it was good the first time i read it and it gets better the second time aroundjacques barzun brings a life of study lecturing and thought to this whirlwind review of the past halfmillennium of western culture  his opinions are strong and he is not reluctant to take strong positions particularly in the latter part of the book which cover the period of his own life he was  when he wrote this book  for the most part i agree with his opinions and even when i dont i have to admit that his arguments are well articulated and demand an equal measure of rigor from the reader to refute themim not sure this can really be called a history  it is more a reasoned dissertation of a point of view  if you want a chronological description of the events of the last  years you should probably look elsewhere  but it is certainly fun to read stimulating at times infuriating in its style it is th century it makes me think of michelet but in its language it is articulate lateth century  jacques barzun is i believe a french immigrant to the united states so it is a eurocentric view of development  and in prof barzuns view western culture underwent a fairly linear development and growth with many reversals all the same until the early th century when it all began to fall aparta final word about prof barzuns writing style  he writes extraordinarily well it is difficult to imagine that his mother tongue was french  i wish i wrote english as well as he doesi can heartily recommend this book  it gets better every time  i look forward to rereading it in 
penman writes beautifully of other times bringing them to life and  making the reader care desperately for her characters all her books are  wonderfulthis however is the best of the lot it was a labour of  love written when she did not know that she would be a successful author  this story is the story she had to tell and tell it she does even knowing  how it will all turn out does not distract from the suspense she weaves  whatever your opinion about the facts of richard iiis life you will be  drawn into this telling yes the plot is determined by penmans opinion  about whether richard killed the little princes or not but thats not  where the power of the book liesthe prose shines with clarity and  grace the characters seem real enough to touch the pacing is splendid  the storytelling is compelling this is a book to read and savour
this book is beautiful it describes a profoundly meaningful life and  offers suggestions to the reader for making her life more meaningful as  well there are passages so beautifully written that i had to read them  over and over again to bask in the moving prose the lovely prose is all  the more impressive when you realize english is not this authors native  languagerebbetzin esther jungreis lives tikkun olam repair of the  world in a way that few of us can emulate there are wonderful inspiring  stories of real people grabbing ahold of their lives and making fundamental  changes in the way they face the world this book should be completely  inspiring  and to some degree it is the author offers a clear view of a  better world and makes concrete suggestions about how to achieve it one  day and one life at a timeso why am i frustrated because the books  solutions which seem so profound at first often turn out to be glib the  author reports conversations which always seem to work to change someones  life theres depth in the stories in the changes people make in their  lives and hope but its all laid out so easily as if just a conversation  is always enough perhaps she only told the stories with the greatest  impact reading one or two at a time is truly inspirational taken  together they offer a tooeasy solution  listen to the rebbetzin and  everything will be okaymore realistically this book will offer you  inspiration and comfort if you want to try to move your life to a better  place what it wont offer is an idea of how hard that is when you have to  live it every day
i usually read a book first and then see the movie i reversed this for mystic river movie was great book was even better of course the books are generally better because of the cutting that must be done to keep the movie from being  hours long but the book mystic river absolutely blew me away the character analysis was terrific dennis lehane went very deep into what made these people behave the way they did definitely one of the best books ive ever read
i have enjoyed dianes books  the natural history of the senses is the first one i read gets you to stop and pay attention  fun read
there are threads
i am not sure this is the correct style for everyone  i am trying to get strong which is typically done using heavy weight and low reps and this training is not designed for that  i think you can only get so strong with this style because you will burn out before you build up
i saw neil strauss who is a bald headed geek interviewed on jimmy kimmel live and was intriqued that someone who looked like that could do what he said so i bought the book  i dont believe a word he says or writes about scoring with women  he couldnt get laid in a whorehouse with a bag full of hundred dollar bills  i do however respect that he has gotten rich and famous in the competitive world of writing and the tough world of show business
i fell for donny deutsch when he was featured on the apprentice and i watch his tv show whenever i can  its different
i found i had to reread to catch back up as it wasnt one that made me want to hurry and see what was coming  i love many of amy tans books my favorite being the joy luck club  this one wasnt up to her standards
i enjoyed the book it had some great tips but its not for a beginner looking for swing fundamentals instead try ben hogans  lessons and david leadbetters  golf still worth reading though
this is a pretty good book i enjoyed reading most of it and it allowed me to relearn a lot of what id forgotten from my junior high and high school history classes and it only took me few days to read itfor those areas of history that youre not familiar with this book is a good summary for those areas you know about youll find the book is quite brief and not always accurate for example in talking about the battle of the little big horn the author says that custer attacked the indians with just over  soldiers in fact custers forces numbered over  hes criticized for dividing his forces and attacking the indian village at several points which may have been why he was wiped out after dividing his forces custer and his group numbered just over  menas other readers have pointed out the author goes off on forays into the plight of the negroblackafrican american population his points are accurate but the amount of attention he gives to this topic makes it seem like a more significant part of our history than it deservesits interesting also to read the difference in the authors writing tone and the attention he gives to events as he moves from historic research to the last  years which he is writing about in large part from the memories of having lived through it rather than heard or read about iti like the book and recommend it
again a great ideahowever i did not feel any real connection between the main characters and writing was a little choppy
i have read all of conn igguldens khan series books and quite enjoyed them  both the history was insightful and the plots and characters made them a pleasure to read
ive enjoyed many viking novelsmostly by cornwell  this was poorly written and not worth the little time i gave it
if you havent met kevin henkes or his little mice characters you and your child or your grandchild are missing a great experience in this book sheila rae has a peppermint stick that shes having a hard time sharing the illustrations are delightful and the situations in all of henkes books are true to life so any child can relate and learn something without a bit of sermonizing if you like this story try owens marshmallow chick and lillys purple plastic purse dont miss the expression in his characters eyes as you flip through the books your little ones will love reading and rereading them the board books are just right for the tiniest hands my oneyear old grandson

what a fantastic book i cant remember when ive read a book as gripping as fadeout  i literally couldnt put it down hansens brilliant voice mesmerized me completelythis was my first joseph hansen book and i was totally blown away by his writing the way he uses his words so economically and the smart dry humor of his he makes all his characters so unique so alive and human and creates the wonderful sense of place throughout the book i enjoyed enormously the heartwrenching mature tone of this story and the elegant sharp way the mystery was laid outand who wouldnt fall for the investigator dave brandstetter himself a man whose last name almost no one remembers who has been around the block a few times who is struggling in the middle of his own personal tragedy but who is still able to feel compassion towards othersi loved it all every wellchosen word every exquisite line and the best part is that i still have  dave brandstetter books to read
i love this series of books for my grandchildren  the puppy is so cute  i plan to purchase more in the series
the book is wonderful but keep in mind half of the book is a catalog of his work for other words ton of pictures that are inch and a half by an inch
i loved the entire series and read one right after the other  i was so drawn into these charactersthe factions and the disturbing thought provoking theme  i am not sure if i want to see the movie because the books were so great
this book was really good fast paced with a good plot from start to finish  my only complaint was the editing  there were many words in the wrong places sometimes more than three times on a page
i loved this book just read what everybody else said for a more complete description id like to point three things out though  the opening chapter is delightful for its combination of mickeyspillaneplot with wodehousegenteellanguage the main character is down on his luck but spins a beautifully sardonic line of highflown thoughts about it all  the author has a fine touch when constructing plot twists that is he didnt give the game away with obvious choices or go for cheap shock value with really unlikely angles instead you think youre figuring things out but then find out you were only halfright and the other facts are still lurking somewhere that is someone has been murderedbut it wasnt exactly how you thought though youre on the right track theres more than one obvious murder method and more than one reasonable suspectit kept me not just guessing but thinkinginstead of distracting you with plot twists or red herrings the author gives you a damn good puzzle to put together and more than one of each piece will fit i enjoyed trying to outguess the main character by putting things together faster than he did  the book has a bitter streak and the ending while not altogether unhappy still punches you in the gut i cant say more without giving it away its emotionally powerful but never gets sappy or melodramatic good stuffanyway i loved it and id love to see more of the authors work with this set of characters or others five stars
really cute story but the email format of the book got a little annoying
i have to agree with one of the other reviewers  great plot poor execution the authors writing style is very limitied  she keeps repeating the same information over and over and its trying to keep reading to get to new information then shell bring up an event that happened in the characters past then drop it and not followthrough with more information im about  thru the book and while im curious to find out how it ends i dont think i can continue
loved it so well written thought the plot was original and the main character is very likeable some good one liners too def recommend it about to download another from pf now
i absolutely loved this book i always thought native american indians were cool most people like cowboys or soldiers i like indians this is about a girl miranda and a warrior shadow walker miranda is very stubborn and she always thought the cheyenne were cruel and barbaric she was the daughter of major thurston and of course thought a certain way about the cheyenne when she is captured by shadow walker on her way to a ranch she thinks she will be killed little did she know he had no intention to kill her in the beginning she refuses to do anything she thought of herself as a prisoner but  not a worker so shadow walker took her on a journey she did not no where and even he did not really know where in the beginning she thinks that shadow walker is a barbaric selfish killer but gradually unexpected feelings arise as she truly gets to know him yes the cheyenne killed some innocent people but the american soldiars too killed with no mercy they soon grow to love each other he had told her a lot about himself and she told him about herself in return but she kept one thing from him that she was the daughter of a major which threatened the safety of shadow walkers tribe eventually shadow walker finds out that miranda is the daughter of a major of an american army he had shared so much of who he was with her but she had kept this from him so of course he was very upset does he forgive her or does he not
i picked up this book and even after first page i was like what who said that who replied that what does this have to do with the story huh after twenty more pages i was totally lost i never even finished it why read a book you cant even understand some books are boring
i have a nasty habit of discovering excellent series in the middle very seldom am i lucky enough to read a novel with characters and situations that i thoroughly enjoy and then later discover that they have been carried over into new novels instead what often happens is that i find out a book i liked is from the middle or sometimes end of an excellent series and i am forced to backtrack and collect the previous booksneedless to say i was not lucky enough to catch manny rupert jerry stahls flighty excop drug addict turned private detective in his first bookplainclothes naked however pain killers is only the second novel in a what will hopefully be a longer seriesstahls writing has always had an edge to it not surprising considering that his real life exploits as recounted inpermanent midnight a memoir have been a tad edgy themselves but it isnt the edge that makes stahls writing so good it is the way he manages to combine it with a dark humor that doesnt flinch at the ugliness unfolding around it a drug addict expoliceman posing as prison rehab counselor in order to investigate a possible exnazi in hiding shouldnt be funny but then stahl throws lines at you like if i were a pedophile
this diet sounds good the theory seems sound the idea is simple but putting the theory into practice was just too hard for me im a mom and wife and trying to get my family to adjust to something this extreme was  simply not reasonable as it was i found it almost impossible to get  through the day without some form of carbos and im not talking needing  big dishes of ice cream even a simple bowl of rice would have been  welcome as well i found the lack of fiber in this diet to be a real  drawback and the suggestion to use things like metamucil and take large  quantities of vitamins to be unrealistic the key to real weight loss seems  simple eat less exercise more this diet just didnt cut it for me
in the poisonwood bible kingsolver has written a manylayered multiplethemed novel of family relationships a missionary family leaves midamerica during the s and moves to the congo with unexpected results the novel speaks with the voices of the women involved the mother orleanna and her three daughters leah rachel and adah kingsolver ably gives voice to each of these women and shows how each views their experience and the man in their lives the preacher father nathan differentlythe book takes a bit of determination to read but rewards same with depth of characterization and plot we follow the various family members over some  years of their lives from the us to the congo and back again each woman reacts differently to the experience of living in africa some reach out and embrace the country and its people some reject the experience and strive to remain the american girls they once were the process is fascinating to watch and it is easy to identify with the charactersthe book does bog down a bit from place to place but by the time it does youre hooked and so slog on to the finish its not mindcandy but it is a rewarding read
i tried the zone for a period of about four months i was religious about it i calculated blocks i got very scientific about meals and in the end found it just too hard for an ordinary housewife with kids and a husband to  keep up with its a tremendous amount of work to get things figured out  and while im sure if i were single id find it easier i just plain didnt  have time and i didnt lose more than about  pounds while i was following  it to the letter so im not convinced of its effectiveness a nice idea if  you can afford to hire a chef to cook for you all the time like madonna or  howard stern but for those of us in the trenches its not very practical
in reading the synopses above and the few negative reviews below i have to wonder if their authors read the book in question or merely the media hype  this book is not about ethnicity and intelligence  its not racism
if you are looking for an unbias history of the jewisharab conflict look no further this is the book to get hold ofthe research is out standing and meticulas there is so much factual information in this volume i would not be without it in my library of referance books on this subject and even then it is at the top of the listit is an eye opener when it comes to the british mandate and britains deliberate betrayal of the jewish people for their own political gain britain should be deeply deeply ashamed britains turning a blind eye to massive illegal arab immigration while denying the jews access directly contravened the league of nations mandate to britain to establish a jewish national home much of the blame for the ongoing conflict can be laid at britains door step due to her shameful behaviorthis book is both shocking and informativeit is heavy going in many places because of the sheer weight of information and factsif you really want the truth and not just the lies of the media this book is a mustwould i recommend it absolutely i would give it ten stars if i couldwould i buy it again if i lost my copy well let me put it this way i will willingly loan out any of my books but this one stays at home
i was delighted that i purchased this book  it was well written and kept my interest from the beginning  just enough detail and not too much to bog things down  i look forward to reading the sequel
this book was an enjoyable read but i am not quite sure of the point it was trying to make    in general it seems to be a critiquestudy of americas current gods like the media but i think the comparisons are often clumsy however it has a bit of an eerie disconcerting feel overall which i enjoyed quite a bit it was an enjoyable read overall
this book is an absolute lifeline and id be lost without it i got it when my son was a baby and  years later i still reccomend itif youre looking for an easy way to parent well hate to break it to you parenting isnt easy if you want to have tools to make the job work better then check this out how to make rules that make sense is a big part of this being consistent is another big thing the core rules taught are just  and these  are the same ones that apply to a toddler as it does a teen rules about safety never change learning how to communicate at the level of the child is covered as welli truly wish that every child came with this book get it
following the rave reviews i thought i would try this book and the first oneit was okit was good on detail but i just found it too easy to put down and not take up againi struggled through the first and then this one thinking that perhaps it would engage me the more i got into the story  unfortunately for me it was just not interesting enough  a bit slow on the action and the conversations seemed to be stilted and quite unrealisticoh well given the reviews of others it is worth a try but if you dont like the first book i dont think it is worth struggling on as i did
i thought i couldnt be a bigger fan of judge judy but this book made me like her even more  you get to see a different fun side of her  she shares some great tips about how to be a strong woman in a way that is more like having a conversation with her than the way she does on her show
i like this torah with commentary and i dont like like this torah with commentary ill keep this short im a christian but i study the torah and try to live by it to the best of my ability i know that probably sounds strange but i have my reasons anyway friedman seems to regard gds word as the supreme authority over man until you get to certain laws that he might not agree with ie
i had never heard this story  found the book and once you start to read it pulls you in to their world of greed love and history of a family that had it all  the authors did a great job writing this book excellent detail and research you cant put it down  if you like true crime this is a great book
i enjoyed the series and think it s more than just for young adults a quick fun read i hope there will be more in the series
i dont know where j speart gets her ideas or the energy to put out one great book after another but clearly she puts a lot of research into her work  i love that she incorporates her research into her story so i dont feel like im reading fact sheet on endangered species  i like to think that i came away from the book not only having been entertained but a little more knowledgeable about our world
the divergent series has all the stuff of any great rollercoaster ride the ups downs twists turns wild loops and hairpin surprises that anyone can ask for in a completely all consuming package thank you veronica roth
you simply cannot go wrong with where the sidewalk ends and never too early to introduce kids to poetry my  year old is simply in love with it we are too
i did not lose my mother from death but from a custody battle and have not seen her since i was  years old  recently i gave birth to my own daughter and from the day i found out i was pregnant with her i could not believe how much grief hurt and confusion that went through me  it was almost as if all of those childhood pains from losing my mother surfaced the day my daughter was born  i felt cluless i raised a son just fine but once i had my daughter i questioned so many things and longed for that motherly affection i so long ago lost  this book was a god send to me because i felt like i was the only one to feel this way  it helped me to understand these feelings of confusion were normal thank you for this book hope
this was the third rachel gibson book ive read and so far my favoritethe writing is adorablevery sexyand fast pacedwhat i liked best about this bookit was written so well i didnt find a single boring sentence that made me feel like skimmingi also found myself smiling through the entire booka common thread with almost all romanticcomedy or romance books is the inevitable ending with a heart achebreakupfor me
i endured the drone of the audio book he could have said it allwith examplesin a minute snippet just three points sum it up if you want to do something disruptive spin off another company or a somewhat isolated department since it is innovative and therefore untested be aware that you cannot project customer reaction in advance nobrainer refine the product by observing how your customers are using your product another nobrainer an organizations capability to go ahead with something innovative is to consider its rpv resources processes and valuesdespite the examples the book comes across as a lot of theory and it really does not have tangible or practical solutions that one can start applying right away we all know dilemmas we want solutions
no turning back changed my views on protecting threatened species  i never had much use for spotted owls or snail darters or threatened toads until i read ellis book  i was shocked by a couple of things  one everything eventually goes extinct  now that i think about it that makes sense but i assumed we humans would be around for a while  two what jerks humans are  the way we hunt stuff down till we wipe the species out is pitiful  ill be more of a conservationist from now on  read the book learn something
once i reintroduced myself to all the characters and various family trees this one slipped on like a pair of favorite shoes would have to say that the reaquainting took about  pages with lots and lots of back and forth flipping to the appendix of families in the back  it was worth the effort though this is an enjoyable addition to the series and frankly the lack of storyline on some of the other characters theyll be in the next book was not a bad thing  the story moved along a bit faster and you bobble back to a prior story line sooner satisfying some of that what happens next issue im not going to mind in the least backing up in the time line to read book  but will have to probably reacquaint myself all over again by the time its released this is a well written series  i highly recommend it

it is ok you can learn a lot of stuff but it is kind of too long if you have enough of free time i guess is ok
you spend around  of the book reading sentences and looking at pictures that say right now i get it ok whats next youre exactly right what the heck does that meanbr br maybe thats how a  yearold learns but thats not how you study a complex subject like design patternsbr br just plain unnecessary verbosity in every single page
i am not a fiction reader probably  books i read if that so i went into this excited for a story that i could enjoy and went in with especially high hopes after reading the reviews listed out on the amazon page unfortunately it didnt live up to the expectations and has been slow and somewhat lethargic which is hard to believe considering the nature of the storyline oftentimes the book feels like it was written for teens but mixes in adult languagecontent at other times so i am not really sure who the target audience is almost as though it was written geared toward multiple audiences i may have to delve into more fiction to see if this is the norm or if i just came across a dud but while the book is mildly entertaining at times it just never really hooks you in which can make finishing it seem more like a chore again maybe i am not the target audience and your mileage may vary but that is what i got out of the experience
i came to this book right after being enthralled with the stories in the last wishbr while i have to suggest it for fans of the witcher it was not quite as digestible as the short stories the main problem was the pacing there didnt seem to be much sense of rising action or confrontation the book reads like a long introduction setting the scene for the following novelsbr another complaint is that this witcher novel seems to give rather short shrift to the witcher himself rather the reader spends a lot of time with female characters who have some deep connection to the witcher including yennifer and the witchers young ward these characters are complex and interesting but nonetheless i was wondering what was going on with geraltbr blood of elves does a lot to fill in the world it paints a very complex and poignant picture of a world with the threat of war hanging over it the views presented are complex and mature
wonderful book in great condition thanks

this was a fast read im not too sure cal murphy would be my type of protagonist i understand spilling what he knows to the fbi in the hopes that they could help but then to his editor and then to his friend kelly i wouldnt want to tell him any secrets i also felt cal and kelly were really connected at least on the surface despite his feelings for her even after kelly confessing at the end of the book she cared about him  the relationship didnt feel truebr br the sea hawks are going to the super bowl and are the favorite to win their quarterbacks son is kidnapped the ransom noah has to throw the game or his son dies it was a fluke that cal found out while interviewing noahbr br major bets are being placed on the dolphins and this raises flags with the fbi so an fbi friend of cals calls him to find out if he knows of any rumors about the game being fixedbr br what follows is an action packed ride to save noahs son before the super bowl  in  daysbr br i received this book free from the author

a purple cow stands out no matter how you look at it now that is being remarkable the challenge in todays marketplace is to become visible rather than to remain invisible in an overcrowded market that contains a multiplicity of similar items from which to choose remarkable means the business or entrepreneur must do something different which is in some way well remarkable what a business or entrepreneur offers to the world must be packaged with originality and design a duo dynamic to effectively set their product out in the forefront ahead of its competition purple cow is more than cutting edge its more than mass advertising its more than a recognizable household name its more than tried and true instead it is original purple cow is offering an item in a new original way it is unusual its consistent its fun its somethingyoumusthave because it is dependable works and meets a need having a great idea or a useful product most likely is not enough without a purple cow something remarkable it will remain invisible to the buyer and relatively unknown to the masses this means that businesses must leverage risk by developing something remarkable in order to become visible innovative ideas are a must for writers like me this is essential what good is a never noticed writing or never read book we must set ourselves apart from the other writers in our genre word of mouth matters too i read purple cow because another author remarked how it changed his outlook and in the process changed his life what purple cow thinking says is this boring is to marketing what business as usual is to static and stale and that is well unremarkable be remarkable offer a remarkable product in this way aim to please your constituency

the shoes fit ok and are decent looking however they absolutely reek i have never in my life smelled anything like this the plastic gassy smell is overpowering my cat smelled them and promptly threw up i put them outside for a week and they still smell just as bad as the first daybr br also they are shipped from china so it takes longer than normal mine took two weeks to arrive which isnt bad consideringbr br all in all i cant recommend these shoes simply because of the stink
i enjoyed this book but like some of the other reviewers said i saw it coming the main plot twist was not that big of a surprise but it did remain interesting i am giving this book  stars because i am glad that i read it it was interesting the characters were interesting and the plot was good i would read a sequel if he ever writes one but i probably wont read this book again

twentysome years more or less have passed since the publication of waymark  harris the book of classic american whiskey and the regans book of bourbon the printed and onlline chatter about americas native spirit has proliferated during that time our own ellenjayecom among them this book by fred minnick has finally taken the place of definitive work on american bourbon if your collection consists of only one book about bourbon this is the book it should contain
the journal really makes you think and i am enjoying it very much thank you
the covers of the books were not cut right causing the pages to stick out on the edges some of the books the pages must have gotten damp they arent a liittle wavey overall the books are good
all in all social norms aside who fears death was a very new kind of story  to me it was very messy in its drama but very clean in the way that it ended this story is very much informed by real world happenings considering that the main character is a child of violent rape however theres a major scififantasy tint to it the book is  over before we find out that the land onye spent the whole book traveling used to be the kingdom of sudan so we can go ahead and file this one under dystopian future as well still i loved it and i look forward to reading okorafors next book bintibr br for the full review please click here httpeurydicehowellcomreviewnnediokoraforswhofearsdeath
fiction has always been a way to safely explore ideas and concepts without riling up those in power science fiction took up this mantle as it was created asking how would man act in spacebr hope  kept me wondering with each turn of the page what would happen next on the surface it is a simple tale about a colony ship that has traveled to another series of worlds and is about to begin settlement under the surface of the words however are some very dark uncomfortable questions can you be called aware and still be blindly obedient to instructions if the perceived best course of action is for a subset of a group to commit suicide so that the rest may flourish is it still the best course of action is there a difference between domestication and slaverybr br books that make me think while telling a damn fine story are my favorite kind hope  is this kind of book and i look forward to jefferys next novel
good content but it lacks photos of the whole tree just photos of the leaves

great bible for  to  year old
great cover
if i could give them  stars i would i cant even access their website because it is always down what a joke to force students to pay  just to do their homework and then not even have the ability to maintain a pretty basic web server this company and all courses that mandate them are bought out jokes
i use to want to read this all the time in nintendo power and it was really nostalgic to me although it doesnt have the lasting appeal i thought it would it was packaged awesome and fairly priced
loved this book really helpful to have something developmentally appropriate to help with talking about the birds and bees to my year old

oh those teenagers raging hormones sibling rivalry heads that are empty of anything except the cutest boy on the ranch rebellion against parental control full of themselves conniving conspiring to get their way    on and on it goes teenagers to think all of us were teenagers once upon a time back in medieval ages    at least thats what teens think about their parents everyone knows mom and dad are so out of touch and old fashionedbr   judging from daughters of the heart nothing has changed today from the s caryl lawrence mcadoo has penned a book to tickle the funny bone and warm the heart her characterizations are spot on her plot believable and her writing compels the reader to turn the page with a villain or two who give rise to a span of time when the readers heart leaps into their throat and three teenage daughters whose common sense has been doused by a healthy dose of hormones not to mention two parents who are kept on their toes from the antics of their brood for sure daughters of the heart will take you hostage and keep you up well past your bedtimebr   this reviewer loved daughters of the heart i do believe it is caryl mcadoos best book yet now up for preorder at amazoncom the reader would be well advised

barrons act  was a very helpful book during my junior year last year i took the aspire test a practice act test and did not do very well i asked my english teacher what i could do to improve my performance he told me to check out this book and it opened up a world of strategies even though the act has evolved recently and this book does have few expired topics the changes are not significant enough to make this book invalid this book has so many useful strategies and unique theories on test taking that it has improved me not just as an act test taker but a test taker in general i am very satisfied with this edition and hope to buy the next one coming out soon

i felt like i was there in the small village in france when reading all about her daily activities meeting her neighbors her classmates and any french person that she decided to stop and try to speak with in french  it is an easy read and very entertaining  the author definitely describes her experiences with precise details and excellent pictures throughout the book  i traveled to france many years ago and did not come home with a great opinion of the french people  glad to learn through karens book that there are many french people who were anxious and willing to show her the ways of their culture and language  they even became very close friends
purchased for a friend having a baby they changed the book a bit since we received it a few years ago my copy has the gigantic plastic googley eyes making it difficult to have in a bookcase the new version has flat eyes making it easier to slip into its bookshelf its a fabulous story and one of my all time favorite kid books be cool little dude and groove on who you is

notes on diversitybr given that the authors of the mark of noba are so deeply involved in the weneeddiversebooks movement i set my expectations high in terms of diversity i am happy to say they deliveredbr br the book starts with sterling wayfairer who is a blond blueeyed cishet straight dude but he is basically the only one of his kind in the book and unlike in  the windup girl  where this viewpoint dominates the narrative and makes the diversity surrounding the central white dude ornamental sterling wayfairer is not put in a position of power or privilege in his world due to his whitenesscisnesshetness virtually all of his friends are teens of color and their presence is not especially noteworthy like with  niko  g l tomas pushes back against white supremacy by creating a world where people of color are thoughtlessly acceptable desirable perfect just as they are racial tensions where sterling lives seem not to exists and this in itself is a strong prodiversity statement br br and then we get tetra tetra is black like very dark black and shes beautiful and strong and smart and flawed so flawed but so redeemable and she is offhandedly queer which made my heart flutter you can already tell i have a massive thing for tetra huh tetra is a great character and she is an especially great black woman character that she is so darkskinned and consistently seen as desirable is another example of g l thomas going the extra distance here in terms of visibility and diversity in their workbr br but wait theres more with sterlings mother we get a character grappling with mental disability and with sterling himself we see how that affects the people she loves laurel sterlings mother was written with such nuance as both the child of a parent with severe mental health issues and as a parent who struggles with mental health themself the delicate and fraught relationship between sterling and laurel really got to me that kind of relationship is very easy to write badly in fiction and ive seen it written badly more than ive seen it written wellbut g l tomas got it right they captured the layers of dependence and complication that the mental illness of a parent causesthe way it turns a child into a caretaker and the way that muddies the relationship between the child and the parentbr br sterling wayfairer is just trying to make the most of his senior year but all he actually seems to do is get in trouble and then things start to get weird theres a girl at school in all his classes that only he seems to remember he starts losing time and then this girl tetra moves into his house convincing his parents that shes a foreign exchange student she says they know each other she says they are bonded she says their from some other world and things get even weirder after thatbr br from tetras perspective shes stumbled into a foreign world to get her bonded traveler up to speed but he remembers nothing literally nothing and theres a monster loose trying to find them to eat their souls she has to protect this entire world get sterling up to speed and protect him from the monster literally all by herself while blending into at a local high schoolbr br the book bounces back and forth between sterling and tetras perspectives giving us insight between how each of them is dealing with this enormously complicated situation whats lovely about the back and forth is that both sterling and tetra have clearly defined and very very different voices sterling is so young and untempered and so casual tetra by comparison is much more formal and more wary and starts of more focused on the task at hand but over the course of the book she loosens up and relaxes into sterlings space his circle of friends his family both of these characters grow a lot of the course of the booksterling matures and tetra seems to get younger andlooser and warmer i think we dont see tetras sort of reversearc enough especially in ya books its especially meaningful to me because i feel like ive gone on a similar emotional journey as tetrabr br all the hallmarks of a ya high school book are heremidterms prom prep party hookupbut with the threat of a sci fi monster in the background if theres one thing i would have changed about the book it would have been a better balance between the high school foregrounding and the monster quest

high enough its foreshadowed well at the beginning but theres a lull in the middle of the book where the naga seems to go into hibernation while sterling and tetra hang out and do high school things

for those interested in eschatologyprophecy and we should all beyou need only read daniel and revelation together as daniel looks forward to revelation and revelation looks back to daniel even our lord jesus christ quoted daniel in matthew mark and luke when the disciples asked him what and when these things would happen he was telling them about the signs of the end time in matthew  his first words were take heed that no one deceives youbr   sadly the very back cover of this book tells of the fact that this books writer was deceived please take note a woman in the true received text of the kjv or nkjv bible represents the church as a whole the bible talks of those who have an hourly walk with jesus who keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus according to revelation  the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy also if you go to the book of daniel in the old testamentyou know that portion of the bible that modern church leaders claim is deadyou will see that when his dreams  visions are interpreted by gabriel the angel he is told that a beast in prophecy is a nation or kingdom read daniel its vital to understanding revelationbr br   to conclude a woman riding a beast is a church ruling over a kingdom or nation i admonish you all to read the bible for yourselves and absolutely run from those who interpret for you read daniel and use those tedious little scripture cross references that most of us ignore they will save your life also read revelation using those cross references pay attention to the  years prophecy as well as the  years prophecy in daniel chapters    these time prophecies are very important to determining when these things spoken of will happen the antichrist has been around for thousands of years and is most definitely the position of bishop of rome in prophecy she that church is known as the scarlot harlot i invite all to read the great controversy by e g whitel to read the great controversy by e g white

this was more than just a soso story and was enhanced by the artwork with every turn of the page i couldnt help but wonder how great it would be if tim burton ever adapted this into a film
i wish there was more of this series
awful in my opinion bizarre nonstandard notation and little to no explanation things seem to just pop out of nowhere i returned it and bought hodel much better book if you want to teach yourself
it doesnt have access code
no access card
excelente propuesta para iniciar la literatura en nios
great recipes by true cretans very easy to follow and more delicious to taste afterwards
exactly what i expected didnt really learn anything new but i do like these books and glad to have it in my collection
it was good not great the writing seemed a bit stilted to me
i really enjoyed reading this story i could not put the book down i just had to know where they were headed i love it when i finish a book  i am still thinking about the characters later  
it has been some time since i read it but i have thoroughly enjoyed all of the cat who  booksi think i read all of them and have now passed them on to my granddaughter  i think the writing is superb and weaving the cat into all the mysteries makes the books hard to put down once started
dont rely on this to teach you python it is however a good companion book or supplement to an actual class you should be taking
excellent reference book
this book does not reflect the customary harper lee wrote this book and her publisher challenged her to do better the publisher believed that the book was worthy of publishing but would not be well received by the public because of its complexity dark subject matter and narrative the publisher challenged harper lee to write something better and harper lee wrote arguably the greatest book ever written fifty years later they find the original manuscript of her first book and publish it this book provides readers with additional insight into scout and her family there are times that the book plods but on the whole the book is entertaining and boasts a strong ending harper lee does not deeply develop the characters but the reader should already know these characters quite well we are blessed to be able to learn more about macomb i have read the original over twenty times and have even read it in spanish italian and english to kill a mockingbird is the greatest book of our time and this is not on the same plateau but go set a watchman is a very good book i give this book a  because it is the perfect followup to to kill a mockingbird the book lacks polish but it also provides the reader with a strong message atticus is not a racist but he is not the paradigm of virtue that we originally envisioned there might be a third novel in the safety deposit box and i eagerly await its publishing
perfect book for learning ucs
beautifully written and kept me engaged

i was given an arc of this for a fair and unbiased review  i have read a ton of stepbrother books and only  or  received more than  stars  selina really pulled me into this story and kept me begging for more it had me laughing  crying and biting my nails  definitely a book i would recommend and reread
wow  what an excellent novel  riveting  highly recommended  the novel includes  survival destruction flawed characters friendships disaster excellent writing information from multiple characters and angles madman who perverts faith death kidnapping and much much more  this book deserves an a
enjoyed reading this novel  liked the characters  like that faith was treated with respect  other aspects of the novel are  a murder great friendships romances a great nun betrayal art treasures brave soldiers war villains betrayal kidnapping babies orphans and much more  other excellent writers of fiction and nonfiction authors are  eric larsen william jarvis margaret mayhew laurie graham duncan barrett judith lennox frances donnelly mary gibson and lynn austin  this books deserve an a
i received this book as an arc for an honest review i must start out by saying that i have read a lot of selena kitts books and i have never been disappointed this book is certainly no exception i loved the storyline and the writing is phenomenal there is a little bit of everything in here for everyone it has the stepbrother angle some bdsm a little sex slavery angle and some very hot panty melting sex scenes to boot this is a must read if you love any of those thingsbr selena you did good cant wait to see whats next for you
excellent chronicling of reddcoins first year  i particularly like the reprinted full interviews with the developers  the beautiful color pictures make this the definitive versionbr br could use a stronger binding
the book was funny the kind of humor i expect from joan rivers
bought this book for my nephew because i know my sister has as much fun reading it to him as i did picking it out cant wait to see how he grows with the book from being read to by his mom to having a growing curiosity i love the extra information about the trains at the end that becomes a jumping board for more learning and research
